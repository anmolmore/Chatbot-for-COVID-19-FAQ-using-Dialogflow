Question,Answer
What is a coronavirus,Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.
What kind of diseases are caused by corona virus,coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
What is covid-19,COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus
When does corona disease started,"Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
what are the symptoms of covid-19,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough"
What are other symptoms of corona,"Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea"
how does covid-19 spread,can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs
Can covid-19 spread through close contact,People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low
can corona spread from asymptotic patitnets,"It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill"
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low
Who is doing research on this disease,WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease ?,Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
What are more ways to protect myself,Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Suggest more ways to protect myself,"Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth."
How to cover my mouth,"Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze"
When should I stay at home,"Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention"
whe should I avoid travel,"avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease."
Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading,Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell
Whe should I seek medical advice,"If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly"
How likely am I to catch covid-19,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there"
Who is at high risk of developing covid-19,"there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher"
Should I worry about covid-19,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults"
I am worried about covid-19,"quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness,"persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)¬†"
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid-19,No
Why antibiotics are not effective in preventing corona virus,No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses
Why antibiotics are not effective in preventing covid-19,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work"

"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for covid-19",Not yet
Is covid-19 the same as sars,No
Should I wear a mask to protect myself,Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
When should I wear a mask to protect myself,wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask","Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water"
How long in incubation period for covid-19,1-14 days
How long in incubation period for corona, Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,Occasionally
Can I catch covid-19 from my pet,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces,few hours or up to several days
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,Yes
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,Yes
Is it possible to be infected with the new coronavirus in Switzerland?,"Yes, and the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus in Switzerland is increasing."
How is the new coronavirus transmitted?,"By close and prolonged contact: If you‚Äôre closer than two metres to a person who has con-tracted the illness.

By droplet infection: If one person sneezes or coughs, the virus can be transported directly to the mucous membranes in the nose, mouth or eyes of other people.

Via your hands: Infectious droplets can get onto your hands from coughing and sneezing. Or you come into contact with a surface contaminated with the virus They can then get into your system if you touch your mouth, nose or eyes."
Why is it important to follow rules on hygiene and how to behave around others?,"We are dealing with a new virus against which humans have not yet developed immunity. That is why so many people are being infected and developing the disease, and why the spread of the new coronavirus must be delayed as far as possible.

In particular those at high risk of becoming seriously ill must be protected. These include people over the age of 65, and those with underlying health conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer) and those with diseases or receiving treatments that weaken the immune system.

If we follow all of the rules (see ¬´Protect yourself and others¬ª), we can reduce the risk of exposing these people to the infection. That way we can also ensure that our health system is able to continue to provide good treatment to those who are seriously ill. This is important because intensive care units only have a limited number of beds and ventilators."
How long is the period between infection and the appearance of symptoms? And when do people become contagious?,"The new coronavirus has an incubation period ‚Äì i.e. the time between infection and the appearance of the first symptoms ‚Äì of around five days. However, this period can last up to 14 days.

Anyone contracting the new coronavirus is infectious for a long time. Namely:

A day before symptoms appear, so before you even notice that you‚Äôve contracted the disease;.
While you are experiencing symptoms of the illness. That is when you are most infectious.
Until at least 48 hours after you have recovered."
What do you have to do if you have been in contact with someone infected with the new coronavirus?,"If you have been in close contact with someone who has been confirmed as having the coronavirus (distance of less than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes), but who is not living in the same household as you, and with whom you have not had intimate relations: Monitor your condition.

If you don‚Äôt have any symptoms (cough [dry cough], sore throat, shortness of breath and/or high temperature, feverishness or muscle ache): Monitor your condition to see if you develop any symptoms.

If you have mild symptoms (cough [dry cough], sore throat, shortness of breath and/or high temperature, feverishness or muscle ache): Isolate yourself at home until you are free of symptoms. Wait a further 48 hours before going out in public (see info on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô).

If your symptoms get worse (fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) or if you have an underlying medical condition and are therefore at especially high risk: Call a doctor or healthcare institution. They will then decide if you need a medical examination, or if it is enough just to stay at home in isolation (see info on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô).

If you live in the same household as someone who is infected, or with whom you have had intimate relations: Stay at home in quarantine for ten days (see info on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô). Monitor your condition to see if you develop any symptoms (high temperature and cough). Follow the advice above."
Can the new coronavirus be transmitted by packages or imports of goods?,"As a rule, a virus can only survive a few hours on objects. This means that packages (such as toys and other items) taking several days to get here are harmless."
Can the new coronavirus be transmitted via foodstuffs?,"So far there are no known cases of the new coronavirus being transmitted through food or drinking water.

If you want to be quite sure, wash and heat foods properly. You will find more information at www.sichergeniessen.ch.

More detailed information on food and nutrition can be found on the website of the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) (in German, French or Italian).

The general rules on hygiene and social distancing are set out in our campaign ‚ÄòProtect yourself and others"
"How great is the risk that pets (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.) will be infected by the coronavirus?","At present we do not have complete information to answer this question. However, scientists believe the risk is only very small.

If a pet lives together in the same home with someone who has coronavirus disease, it might possibly become infected with the virus or contaminated. The animals themselves will not display any symptoms of illness; in other words they will not contract the disease.

More detailed information on handling animals can be found on the website of the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office FSVO (in German, French or Italian)."
What should pet owners do if they are put in isolation at home?,"Pet owners in this situation must as far as possible avoid contact with their pets (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.). They should have a healthy person look after their animals.

If dogs have to go outside, they should be kept on a lead and stay outdoors only briefly. If possible the person accompanying them should avoid contact with other people and animals.

Dogs and cats from a household in quarantine do not have to be specially bathed or disinfected.

The following rule applies to everyone: wash your hands after contact with an animal.

More detailed information on handling animals during this extraordinary situation due to the coronavirus can be found on the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office FSVO (in German, French or Italian)."
"Can the coronavirus be transmitted via door handles, mobile phones or other everyday objects?","Yes. If a person infected with coronavirus sneezes or coughs into the air, instead of into a tissue or the crook of their arm, droplets containing the virus land on surfaces. If you then come into contact with these surfaces and touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your hand, the virus can get into your body and you can become infected.

Important:

Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water.
Avoid touching your face.
Cough or sneeze into a paper tissue or the crook of your arm.
Wash your hands every time you cough or sneeze.."
What surfaces can the coronavirus attach itself to? And how long does it remain infectious?,"The virus can cling to surfaces and objects.

At the moment, there are no clear indications as to how long the virus can remain infectious on different surfaces.

Important: Regularly clean objects or surfaces that you touch frequently. Use a regular cleaning product."
¬†Can I still give blood?,"Even in the current situation with the coronavirus, people who are seriously ill or injured need blood transfusions.

If you are healthy, you can still give blood as usual. Blood donation centres guarantee that they will comply with the rules on hygiene and social distancing while you are giving blood.

Please be sure to arrange an appointment before going to a blood donation centre. You will find a list of opening hours for blood donation centres and mobile blood donation campaigns at"
 Can the coronavirus be passed on through the blood?,There are no indications that the coronavirus can be passed on through the blood. The transmission of the virus via donated blood is therefore highly unlikely
Am I at especially high risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 if I‚Äôm pregnant?,"There is no evidence at present that healthy pregnant women are at especially high risk of becoming seriously ill. Nevertheless, if you are pregnant you should take every precaution to protect yourself from becoming infected as an acute illness ‚Äì particularly a cough and high temperature ‚Äì can have an impact on the pregnancy.

We therefore recommend that you strictly follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing.

Your employer is responsible for implementing protective measures in the workplace."
I‚Äôm pregnant and have questions about the coronavirus. Who should I contact?,"If you have specific questions about your pregnancy, please contact your gynaecologist or midwife. They can assess your situation and discuss any measures you need to take.

If you experience any symptoms that could indicate a coronavirus infection, call your gynaecologist to discuss further steps."
I‚Äôve contracted the coronavirus and am expecting a child. Is my baby at risk?,"There is currently no evidence that babies have become infected with the new coronavirus during pregnancy when the mother had contracted COVID-19 before the birth. So far, no viruses have been detected in a mother‚Äôs amniotic fluid or breast milk.

However, the new-born baby can become infected after birth via droplets (coughing, sneezing, kissing). However, there is currently no evidence that new-born babies are at increased risk of severe illness.

You can still breastfeed your baby, but it is important that you follow the special hygiene rules. These can protect your new-born child from infection."
I‚Äôm pregnant and have been in contact with someone infected with the coronavirus. What should I do?,"First and foremost the same rules apply as for everyone else: you have to place yourself in quarantine.
If you experience symptoms of illness (shortness of breath, cough, high temperature), contact your gynaecologist immediately to discuss the necessary steps."
I‚Äôm pregnant and am in a high-risk group as I have an underlying medical condition. What should I do?,"If you are expecting and have an underlying medical condition, contracting the new coronavirus could be harmful to you. You would therefore be categorised as being at especially high risk.

We would strongly urge you to follow our recommendations for people at especially high risk.
If you experience symptoms of illness, contact your gynaecologist immediately to discuss the necessary steps."
I‚Äôm pregnant and infected with the new coronavirus and the baby is due. What should I do?,"You should self-isolate at home and notify your gynaecologist straight away, as well as the hospital where you are due to give birth. If you have to go to the hospital or medical practice before the due date, or as an emergency case, call beforehand and tell them that you have tested positive for coronavirus. You will then be told what to do next. Travel to the appointment by car if at all possible."
I‚Äôm pregnant and still going to work. Does that pose a threat to me and my unborn child?,"There is no evidence at present that pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting the new coronavirus. Pregnant women can still go to work as long as their employer respects the applicable rules on hygiene and social distancing. If these measures are not observed in the workplace, pregnant women are afforded special protection under the Maternity Health and Safety Ordinance."
What are the symptoms of coronavirus disease?,"The symptoms are very variable, non-specific and can vary in severity. The following symptoms can occur:

Cough (usually dry)
Sore throat
Shortness of breath
High temperature, feverishness
Muscle ache
More rarely:

Headache
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Conjunctivitis
Head cold
Loss of sense of smell and/or taste
Complications such as pneumonia are also possible.

Nor everyone with symptoms will be tested for the new coronavirus. However, if you experience one or more of the above symptoms, there is a high likelihood that you have contracted the new coronavirus.

You have to stay at home for 10 days once one of these symptoms occurs. Follow the instructions on self-isolation. Avoid all contact with other people during this time. Stay at home for a further 48 hours after you have recovered.

Most people will only experience a mild illness. However, in particular those over the age of 65, or those with an underlying medical condition could become seriously ill. Further information can be found under People at especially high risk and COVID-19, symptoms and treatment, origins of the new coronavirus."
I have a high temperature and a cough. What should I do?,"As well as a cough and/or a high temperature, other indications of a coronavirus infection may include a sore throat, shortness of breath, feverishness or muscle ache.

You can be infected with coronavirus without experiencing strong symptoms. Sometimes only one of the symptoms may occur.

If you experience one of these symptoms, you must self-isolate at home so as not to infect other people. Avoid contact with other people as much as possible. If you only experience mild symptoms, you can look after yourself at home. Please follow the instructions provided under self-isolation and self-quarantine.

If you are at high risk of becoming seriously ill or your symptoms get worse, call your doctor. They will then decide whether you need a medical examination or whether it is sufficient for you to stay at home and nurse yourself."
What should I do if I‚Äôve been in contact with a person displaying coronavirus symptoms?,"Do you live in the same household as this person?

Or have you had physical contact (e.g. hug, kiss) with someone who then experienced coronavirus symptoms 24 hours later?

If the answer to either of those questions is ‚Äòyes‚Äô, there is a high likelihood that that you have contracted the virus. It is therefore important that you don‚Äôt infect anyone else. Quarantine yourself at home.

You can find information on what that involves under Self-isolation and Self-quarantine. Carefully follow the instructions."
How is an infection with the new coronavirus detected?,"Every suspected case of infection with the new coronavirus must be investigated by a doctor. The doctor will ask questions about travel, contact with other people and symptoms such as fever, coughing or respiratory problems.

Laboratory testing is the only way of obtaining conclusive confirmation. A lab test can be done, for example, with a nose and throat swab (nasopharyngeal swab). If the lab confirms infection, the person who has contracted the disease will be isolated in accordance with the cantonal medical officer‚Äôs instructions."
What treatment is there for the new coronavirus disease?,"At the moment there is no specific treatment for the disease caused by the coronavirus. Treatment is limited to easing the symptoms. To protect other people, those infected are placed in isolation. In serious cases, patients usually require intensive care, which may involve artificial ventilation."
Can COVID-19 (new coronavirus disease) be treated with antibiotics?,"No. Antibiotics only work for bacteria, not viruses. For this reason it is not possible to cure the new coronavirus disease with antibiotics."
Is there a connection between Ibuprofen and COVID-19?,"There is no scientific data to indicate that such a connection exists at the present time. There is no demonstrable proof that Ibuprofen has an effect on the progression of COVID-19.

Instead it is important to know whether patients ill with COVID-19 have any pre-existing conditions or are currently suffering from any other diseases. As is always the case, the treatment will then be carefully adapted to the patient‚Äôs situation.

We recommend that you always keep a list of any medication that you have taken. You should list any medication prescribed by a doctor, as well as any medication you have taken yourself."
"What is ‚Äôself-isolation‚Äô, and what does it involve for me?","If someone experiences minor symptoms of illness (a cough (irritating dry cough), sore throat, shortness of breath and/or high temperature, feverishness, muscle ache), they will not be tested for the novel coronavirus (unless they are at risk because they have an underlying, pre-existing condition). This person then remains voluntarily in so-called self-isolation at home, minimising their contact with other people, including those living in the same household. This way they can avoid infecting others.

You can end the period of self-isolation yourself once you have been free of symptoms for 48 hours (see the page on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô).

People with symptoms of illness for whom a doctor has decided a test is necessary: If the test is positive, the person remains isolated until 48 hours after they have recovered, and at least ten days from the moment their symptoms of illness appeared (see the fact sheet on ‚Äòself-isolation‚Äô further down in the Documents tab). Because it is not clear when the risk of passing on the infection ends, even after this they should continue to follow the rules of hygiene and how to behave."
"What is quarantine, and what do I have to bear in mind?","In voluntary quarantine, the people who live with or have intimate contact with a person with the disease stay at home voluntarily and minimise their contact with other people (see the page on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô and the fact sheet on ‚ÄòSelf-quarantine‚Äô further down in the Documents tab).

If members of a family living together in the same household are in voluntary quarantine, the healthy members can continue to have contact with each other. The person with the disease, however, should remain in self-isolation and avoid contact with the others (see the page on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation and self-quarantine‚Äô and the fact sheet on ‚ÄòSelf-isolation‚Äô further down in the Documents tab).

The healthy family members can come out of quarantine if they have not developed symptoms after ten days. Ten days is the period within which most people display the first symptoms.

If symptoms of illness arise during quarantine, the person affected must also go into self-isolation. They only have to go to the doctor if their state of health requires or if they are a person at especially high risk."
Should I wear a hygienic mask?,"No, healthy people should not wear hygiene masks (surgical masks) in public. If you are in good health, they do not protect you effectively from infection with respiratory viruses (i.e. for your own protection). Wearing a mask can therefore give you a false sense of security.
Excluded from this recommendation:

If you have a respiratory condition: A face mask can prevent someone who is ill from infecting others. This means you should wear one if you cannot keep at least two metres away from other people (e.g. at home, at the doctor‚Äôs, pharmacy, or when using public transport to get to and from a visit to the doctor).
If you have to wear a mask at work, e.g. healthcare personnel or care workers looking after people in poor health.
Bear in mind: If you see someone wearing a face mask, it doesn‚Äôt mean that the person is infected with the coronavirus. There maybe various reasons for wearing a mask. Whatever the reason, be friendly and supportive."
How can the new coronavirus be rendered harmless?,"If clothes or body parts have been contaminated with the new coronavirus (for example by excretions), you should wash them with soap and water. You can clean objects and surfaces with commercially available cleaning agents."
How can the coronavirus be removed from surfaces or laundry?,"To be on the safe side, clean household appliances and surfaces that could be contaminated with the virus ‚Äì and that you use or touch often ‚Äì regularly and thoroughly. You can use a regular cleaning product.

Wash crockery, glasses, cups and kitchen utensils in the dishwasher or by hand with washing-up liquid after use.

Wash your clothing, bed linen and bath towels regularly in the washing machine."
 Does a private meal with friends count as a prohibited event?,"Private meals do not fall under the ban. But in this critical situation, we must all keep our social interactions to an absolute minimum. We are therefore appealing to your sense of responsibility: avoid all social interaction that is not absolutely necessary.

Follow the rules on hygiene and keep a distance of at least 2 metres from others at all times."
 Can I still meet up with my friends?,"As a general rule, stay at home. Particularly if you are ill or over the age of 65, you should only leave the home in exceptional circumstances.

Gatherings of more than five people in public are prohibited. This rule also applies to large families or households. The police can issue you with a fine if you do not follow these rules.

If you do meet up with up to four other friends, you must also keep a distance of at least two metres. Naturally, normal contact such as a mother holding hands with her child or a husband supporting his sight-impaired wife while out walking, is still allowed.

Keep your social interactions to an absolute minimum. That means:

No drinks after work with our colleagues
No private parties
No playing soccer with friends
No invitations to children‚Äôs birthday parties
Do not meet in groups of more than five people and keep at least two metres apart and follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing."
 Are children still allowed to meet up with friends to play?,"We understand that looking after children poses a challenge in the current situation. However, it is important that no large groups of children gather in parks or other public spaces. Gatherings of small groups of no more than five children are permitted. But it is important that parents or other adults do not gather too. Older people or those at especially high risk are not allowed to have contact with children."
" Can I still go to a concert, the theatre, a party or an open day?","No, that‚Äôs not possible right now. The following events, for example, are not permitted:

Concerts
Conferences
Theatre performances
Cinema performances
Circuses
Parties
Sports events
Demonstrations
Street or village parties
Fairs and farmers‚Äô markets
Company events
Open days"
 We are organising a demonstration ‚Äì it that still ok?,"No, organising or participating in demonstrations is not allowed."
 Can I go to a place of worship?,"Religious services are not permitted. However, you may visit a place of worship if you are alone.

If you still come into contact with other people, keep at least two metres apart, and follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing."
 Can I organise an Annual General Meeting or attend one?,"No, neither is possible. AGMs at which delegates attend in person are prohibited; if one is to go ahead, special authorisation must be obtained from the relevant cantonal authority. There is no problem however if delegates exercise their rights in writing or electronically, or through an independent shareholder proxy designated by the organiser."
 Can I still take my driving lessons?,"No, driving lessons are not allowed."
 Are taxi firms and other private transport services also covered by the ban?,"No, they can continue to operate. But the FOPH‚Äôs rules must be strictly adhered to including maintaining an appropriate distance between people."
 Establishments providing personal services involving physical contact have to close. Which businesses are affected and which aren‚Äôt?,"Service providers affected include hairdressers, massage and tattoo parlours, cosmetic studios and driving schools. Establishments offering only advisory services are not included. In going about their business, all these establishments must follow the FOPH‚Äôs recommendations. Rules on hygiene must be adhered to and people must keep sufficient distance from one another"
 What is the situation regarding stores that also stock products other than everyday items? Do sections containing non-essential items have to be blocked off?,"Stores with assorted product ranges may only sell items for everyday use. Sections containing other products must be closed or blocked off wherever possible. Large retailers with flower shops in their stores must block these off and close them. Department stores with food sections on the ground floor or in the basement, for example, may stay open, but all other floors must remain closed.

Where stores offer a large blend of  products in the same section, the store must undertake practicable measures to ensure that non-essential items are blocked off, e.g.  large areas with perfumes and the like in drug stores, toy or clothes sections in supermarkets. These types of product may no longer be sold. The store must block off such sections or cover the shelves."
 Can bakeries and butchers also stay open?,"Yes, these are considered food stores and therefore do not have to close. However, bakeries may only sell goods over the counter. If they have a caf√© section, that must remain closed."
 Are commercial enterprises covered by the ban?,"Commercial enterprises not accessible to the public, do not have to close and can continue to operate.

Commercial enterprises accessible to the public, must close those parts accessible to the public, e.g. electrical stores or garden centres."
 What are the rules for construction sites?,"Construction sites are not affected by the new rules and do not have to close. However, the rules on hygiene and social distancing must be respected. If this is not possible in the normal course of operation, the following measures must be taken:

Number of workers on site must be limited
Way in which construction site and operations are organised must be adapted
Gatherings of more than five people in canteen/rest area must be prevented (more than five people can still be present in large canteens as long as they keep their distance)
These measures are likely to complicate the construction process. However, construction site operators must take this into account given the need to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. If workers are unable to adhere to the rules on hygiene and social distancing despite these measures, the relevant cantonal authorities may decide to shut down the site."
" Are internal meetings allowed? If so, under what conditions?","Internal meetings are still allowed. But those attending the meeting must follow the rules on hygiene and social distancing (i.e. washing hands, not shaking hands, keeping a distance). As a guideline roughly 4m"
 What rules apply to the hospitality and catering industry?,"Restaurants serving guests on the premises must close. The following catering outlets may continue to operate:

Snack bars (without seating) such as:
Take away establishments
Food trucks
Establishments from which meals can be ordered for collection
Staff canteens
Meal delivery services
Restaurants serving hotel guests"
What is Novel Coronavirus,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis."
"Why is disease called coronavirus diease 2019, COVID - 2019","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‚ÄòCO‚Äô stands for ‚Äòcorona,‚Äô ‚ÄòVI‚Äô for ‚Äòvirus,‚Äô and ‚ÄòD‚Äô for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‚Äú2019 novel coronavirus‚Äù or ‚Äú2019-nCoV‚Äù.
There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practice
external icon
 for naming of new human infectious diseases."
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? ,"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
after using the bathroom and before eating. "
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,"Protection measures for everyone Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news."
"Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past
14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading ","Follow the guidance outlined above (Protection measures for
everyone)
o Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even
with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C
or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is
essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go
out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other
people.
Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities
will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help
protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other
viruses. "
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
COVID-19."
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:
about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
movement and gatherings. "
Who is at risk of developing severe illness,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others"
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a
physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
"Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure
COVID-19","While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not
recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several
ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon
as clinical findings are available. "
Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19,"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should
be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. "
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the
outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are
quite different"
Should I wear mask to protect myself,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
wisely. "
How to put on use take off and dispose of a mask?,"1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,
and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
hand rub or soap and water
3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
coloured side).
6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
7. Pull down the mask‚Äôs bottom so it covers your mouth and your
chin.
8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
of the mask.
9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
mask ‚Äì Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
your hands with soap and water. "
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The ‚Äúincubation period‚Äù means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which 
may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not
yet been confirmed. "
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available. "
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). "
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and
can be harmful:
‚Ä¢ Smoking
‚Ä¢ Wearing multiple masks
‚Ä¢ Taking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of
therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"") "
Is this virus comparable to SARS or to the seasonal flu?,"The novel coronavirus detected in China in 2019 is closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died.

As of 30 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over 700 000 cases worldwide since the first case was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more than 30 000 are known to have died. 

See the situation updates for the latest available information."
 What is the mode of transmission? How (easily) does it spread?,"While animals are believed to be the original source, the virus spread is now from person to person (human-to-human transmission). There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three other people. 

The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity (usually less than one metre). These droplets can then be inhaled, or they can land on surfaces that others may come into contact with, who can then get infected when they touch their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours (copper, cardboard) up to a few days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection."
When is a person infectious?,"The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear, but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. The infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases."
How severe is COVID-19 infection? ,"Preliminary data from the EU/EEA (from the countries with available data) show that around 20-30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalised and 4% have severe illness. Hospitalisation rates are higher for those aged 60 years and above, and for those with other underlying health conditions."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19 infection,"Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity from having no symptoms at all (being asymptomatic) to having fever, cough, sore throat, general weakness and fatigue and muscular pain and in the most severe cases, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, all potentially leading to death. Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease.

Recently, anosmia ‚Äì loss of the sense of smell ‚Äì (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection. There is already evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia, in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms."
Are some people more at risk than others?,"Elderly people above 70 years of age and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females."
Are children also at risk of infection and what is their potential role in transmission?,"Children make up a very small proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, with about 1% of all cases reported being under 10 years, and 4% aged 10-19 years. Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease. There is still some uncertainty about the extent to which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children transmit disease."
What is the risk of infection in pregnant women and neonates?,"There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date.

ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice."
Is there a treatment for the COVID-19 disease?,"There is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease.

Healthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus, and provide supportive care (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) for infected persons, which can be highly effective.

In severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials. Several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available.

As this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans."
When should I be tested for COVID-19?,"Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.

As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups:

hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;
symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;
cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;
elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions."
Where can I get tested?,"If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or general weakness), it is recommended that you contact your local healthcare services online or by telephone. If your healthcare provider believes there is a need for a laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19, he/she will inform you of the procedure to follow and advise where and how the test can be performed."
Do persons suffering from pollen allergy or allergies in general have a higher risk to develop severe disease when having COVID-19?,"A large proportion of the population (up to 15-20%) reports seasonal symptoms related to pollen, the most common of which include itchy eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose and sometimes wheezing and skin rash. All these symptoms are usually referred to as hay fever, pollen allergy or more appropriately allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergic asthma in children and adults.

Allergies, including mild allergic asthma, have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for a more unfavourable outcome in the studies available so far. Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily, is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease.

Children and adults on maintenance medication for allergies (e.g. leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators) need to continue their treatment as prescribed by their doctor and should not discontinue their medication due to fears of COVID-19. If they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they will need to self-isolate, inform their doctor and monitor their health as everyone else. If progressive difficulty breathing develops, they should seek prompt medical assistance.
"
How can we differentiate between hay fever/pollen allergy related respiratory symptoms and COVID-19 infection?,"Someone with COVID-19 usually has mild, flu-like symptoms (see above question 1), which are rather common and need to be distinguished from similar symptoms caused by common cold viruses and from allergic symptoms during springtime.

The following table presents a comparison of the most common symptoms of all three conditions according to their reported frequency.

It is good to bear in mind that the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is not clinical, but through laboratory testing of a sample from the nose or mouth."
Should people who suffer from pollen allergy self-isolate if they develop typical hay fever symptoms?,"No, there is no more reason for people suffering from pollen allergy to self-isolate if they develop their typical hay-fever symptoms than for anyone else. They should continue following the general guidance for physical distancing and seek medical advice if their symptoms get worse, if they develop fever or progressive difficulty breathing."
How can I avoid getting infected?,"The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.

Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands thoroughly with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings. It is also recommended to stay one metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms, to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets."
How can I avoid infecting others?,"Cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue. If you use a tissue, dispose of it carefully after a single use
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Stay one metre or more away from people to reduce the risk of spreading the virus through respiratory droplets.
If you feel unwell, stay at home. If you develop any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, you should immediately call your healthcare provider for advice."
What is physical distancing and why and how should I do it?,"Physical distancing aims to reduce physical contact between potentially infected people and healthy people, or between population groups with high rates of transmission and others with low or no level of transmission. The objective of this is to decrease or interrupt the spread of COVID-19.

Note that the term ‚Äòphysical distancing‚Äô means the same thing as the widely used term ‚Äòsocial distancing‚Äô, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people keep physically apart. Physical distancing measures might be implemented over an extended period and their success depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact ‚Äì from a distance ‚Äì with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communications and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy."
What should I do if I develop symptoms of COVID-19?,Follow the guidelines of the public health authorities in your area on the steps to take or call the local COVID-19 helpline.
Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?,"If you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people. On the other hand there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from becoming infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes while wearing them. The inappropriate use of masks also may increase the risk of infection."
Is there a vaccine against the virus? ,"There are currently no vaccines against human coronaviruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19. This is why it is very important to prevent infection and to take measures to contain further spread of the virus."
How long will it take to develop a vaccine?,"The development of vaccines take time. Several pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories are working on vaccine candidates. It will, however, take months or years before any vaccine can be widely used, as it needs to undergo extensive testing in clinical trials to determine its safety and efficacy.  These clinical trials are an essential precursor to regulatory approval and usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world badly affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is in the field, and the third does the same in several thousand people."
Am I protected against COVID-19 if I had the influenza vaccine this year?,Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses and the seasonal influenza vaccine will not protect against COVID-19.
What is the situation in Europe at the moment?,"In the last month, the number of cases and deaths reported in the EU/EEA has increased exponentially from less than 2 000 cases to more than 350 000 (as of 30 March). During this time, all EU/EEA countries have reported increasing numbers of new cases; Italy has reported more than 90 000 new cases and Spain more than 75 000 new cases. If this trend continues, based on the quick pace of growth of the epidemic observed in China and northern Italy, it is likely that in days, or a small number of weeks, nationally incapacitating epidemics will be observed in most EU/EEA Member States."
How prepared is Europe for COVID-19? ,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has evolved dramatically in the EU/EEA and the UK. The rapid escalation of cases in countries such as Italy and Spain has placed enormous pressure on healthcare systems, and presented a major challenge for local services. All countries in the EU have responded to the emerging situation. The situation continues to evolve and lessons are still being learnt and countries are working hard to adapt their response to the ever changing situation."
What is the EU doing?,"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is in continuous contact with the European Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the assessment of this outbreak. 

To inform the European Commission and the public health authorities in Member States of the ongoing situation, ECDC publishes daily updates and continuously assesses the risk for EU citizens. ECDC and WHO develop technical guidance to support countries in their response. The European Commission is ensuring the coordination of risk management activities at EU level."
Am I at risk of contracting COVID-19 infection in the EU?,"This outbreak is evolving rapidly. ECDC is continuously assessing the risk for EU citizens and the risk assessment is changing accordingly. As this is a new virus, most people do not have any immunity that can safeguard against infection.

You can find the latest information in the daily situation update and the regular ECDC risk assessment."
How many people have been infected in the EU/EEA?,"COVID-19 is spreading rapidly worldwide, and the number of cases in Europe is increasing exponentially in many affected areas.

See the ECDC daily situation update for the latest available numbers."
How long will this outbreak last? When will we see the peak?,"Any predictions about when the peak will come and how long the outbreak will last are purely speculative at this stage. As greater evidence emerges regarding the nature of the virus and the effectiveness of measures used to control the outbreak, predictions relating to the future course of COVID-19 will become more reliable."
Should schools and day centres be closed?,"The evidence we have to date indicates that COVID-19 does not cause serious illness in children ‚Äì not nearly as much as it does for adults. However, they can be infected as easily as adults, though the extent to which children play a role in the transmission of the virus to others is still uncertain.

Depending on local circumstances, local authorities may decide to temporarily close schools and day care centres to reduce transmission in the community. However, school closures may have an impact on availability of healthcare staff and other essential services, due to the need for having to  care for their children when not in school, which needs to be taken into consideration (e.g. some countries only maintain schooling for these children of staff in a critical role). Also, if grandparents are asked to care for the children, the benefits of lower transmission between children might be offset by transmission into a more vulnerable population group. Wherever school closure happens, it is important that parents and caregivers are supported, for example by their employers applying teleworking or limited office shift schedules, so they can stay at home more and take care of their children."
Where can I learn more about the situation and the guidelines from my country?,"Each EU/EEA country and the UK have dedicated websites with information for the public on COVID-19 and on the national situation.

Consult with your national authorities to get advice tailored for your setting. "
What are the travel restrictions in the European Union?,"Travel has been shown to facilitate the spread of COVID-19 from affected to unaffected areas. Travel and trade restrictions during a public health event of international concern (PHEIC) are regulated under the International Health Regulations (IHR), part III.

On 16 March, in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the European Union leaders agreed to a temporary restriction on non-essential travel from third countries into the EU area by closing its borders for the next 30 days staring on 17 March 2020 The temporary travel restriction foresees exemptions for nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland; whilst UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until end 2020), for the purposes of returning to their homes. Exceptions are also foreseen for travellers with an essential function or need.

In addition, most EU countries have also applied national borders closure and/or border checks and travel and transport restrictions or bans within their national borders and between different regions as a measure to slow the spread. See the measures implemented by EU Member States.

Mobility measures implemented or announced by Member States

Many EU countries have also encouraged their citizens to return home (with recommendations  for 14 days self-quarantine upon return) but also recommended that travellers avoid non-essential travels to areas with transmission of COVID-19."
What precautions should I take if I need to travel?,"Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider."
What is the risk of infection when travelling by plane?,"The risk of being infected on an airplane cannot be excluded, but is currently considered to be low for an individual traveller. The risk of being infected in an airport is similar to that of any other place where many people gather. If it is established that a COVID-19 case has been on an airplane, other passengers who were at risk (as defined by how near they were seated to the infected passenger) will be contacted by public health authorities. Should you have questions about a flight you have taken, please contact your local health authority for advice. 

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommended measures to be taken by national authorities, such as thorough disinfecting and cleaning of aircraft after each flight serving high-risk destinations. EASA also recommended that airlines operating on all routes step up the frequency of cleaning, disinfect as a preventative measure and ensure full disinfection of any aircraft which has carried a passenger who was suspected or confirmed as being infected with COVID-19. Airport operators should similarly disinfect terminals regularly."
 Why are people not being checked for COVID-19 at the airport when arriving from areas of local or community transmission?,"There is evidence that checking people at the airport by reading their skin temperature (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival."
What is the risk of getting COVID-19 from packages delivered through the postal system?,"A recent study published by The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported that the causal agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to persist for up to 24 hours on cardboard, in experimental settings (e.g. controlled relative humidity and temperature). In practice however there is no evidence of the infection ever being transmitted through contaminated packages that are exposed to different environmental conditions and temperatures.'"
"Are people working in the supply chain including logistics, control services, retail, etc. at risk of getting COVID-19 by handling packages? What measures can be taken to reduce the risk of getting infected in this type of work setting?","People working in the supply chain, including logistics, control services, retail, etc. are not at greater risk to of getting COVID-19 as a result of managing packages. ECDC does not recommend any special measures at the supply chain over and above those addressed to the general public: frequent and thorough hand washing and use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants, keeping a distance from other employees, and not working if showing signs of respiratory symptoms."
Are couriers at risk of getting COVID-19 by handling packages? What measures can be taken to reduce the risk of getting infected in this type of work setting?,"People working as couriers are not at greater risk of getting COVID-19 as a result of managing packages. Couriers delivering packages at homes are advised to keep a distance from the customer, use alcohol-based hand disinfectant frequently (and always before and after contact with a customer), and avoid working if showing signs of respiratory symptoms."
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from food products imported from affected areas?,"There has been no report of transmission of COVID-19 via food, and therefore there is no evidence that food items imported into the European Union in accordance with the applicable animal and public health regulations pose a risk for the health of EU citizens in relation to COVID-19. The main mode of transmission is from person to person."
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from animals or animal products imported from affected areas?,There is no evidence that any of the animals or animal products authorised for entry into the European Union pose a risk to the health of EU citizens as a result of the presence of COVID-19.
What is the risk of COVID-19 infection from contact with pets and other animals in the EU?,"Current research links COVID-19 to certain types of bat as the original source, but does not exclude the involvement of other animals. Several types of coronaviruses can infect animals and can be transmitted to other animals and people. There is no evidence that companion animals (e.g. dogs or cats)‚ÄØpose a risk of infection to humans, however there is one report from Hong Kong of a pet dog that had positive swabs and showed serological evidence that it was likely infected by its owner who got COVID-19. As a general precaution, it is always wise to observe basic principles of hygiene when in contact with animals."
Do schools remain open?,"Lessons will be cancelled (nursery/ primary/ secondary) as well as extracurricular activities. Schools ensure the reception of children, organised exclusively by the internal staff. "
Can new initiatives to organize the care of children be organized?,"No, only organization already in place can pursue their activities. New initiatives beyond existing contacts are forbidden."
Are companies allowed to take initiatives for the care of children of their employees?,"If such care systems already existed, they can continue. However, no new childcare initiatives can be set up. It is necessary to avoid putting together children who did not come into contact with each other beforehand."
How can I organize the reception of my children if I have to go to work?,"It is not advisable to entrust children to the elderly, who are among the groups vulnerable to coronavirus. However, you can entrust your children to another member of your family, to a relative, to your children‚Äôs school which will organise the reception or to an independent carer. All solutions that do not involve vulnerable people are acceptable."
Are nurseries open?,"Yes, nurseries and child minders remain open for children up to 3 years old."
How can child minders apply social distancing?,The necessary hygienic measures have to be followed but social distancing is difficult with regard to children. Social distancing measures do however have to be strictly observed by parents. It is true that groups of children from the same cr√®che are often seen as a uniform whole.
What about children of (possibly) infected parents?,"If the parent is suspected of being infected, the children must stay at home. Young children show hardly any symptoms if infected, and only become ill in exceptional cases, although they pass on the disease, which is why it is requested that they are kept at home."
What about higher education institutions?,Universities and higher education institutions organize distance learning.
What about university students' exams?,This will be determined after a new evaluation of the situation.
Are evening courses or continuing education establishments continuing to operate?,Evening classes and continuing education must also develop distance learning solutions.
Are special education establishments and boarding schools open?,"The boarding schools and special needs education remain open, but the lessons are cancelled."
Will schools for security professions be closed?,"Schools for security professions continue primary education through remote classes, or help the crisis effort by providing training-on-the-job."
Can my handicapped child still go to the day care center?,"Yeah, they stay open."
When can I go outside?,"Yeah, they stay open."
You‚Äôre expected to stay home as much as possible. You‚Äôre only allowed to come out if necessary for the following things:  ,"Yeah, they stay open."
What can I do myself?,"You have to respect the general hygiene measures and to keep a distance of at least 1.5 meter with other people, except for members of a family living under the same roof. For example, by always leaving a free seat between two people during a necessary meeting. You have to avoid putting a mix of different ages in the same place."
Do administrative services remain open?,"Administrations must continue to function in order to guarantee their services, subject to social distancing measures and/or teleworking where possible. The public administrations must inform the public about the possibilities of obtaining documents and information via alternative channels (online). The administration must give preference to these alternative channels to limit the number of journeys made."
Is door-to-door collection of household waste allowed to continue?,"Yes, the various waste collections (residual waste, green waste, paper and cardboard and PMD) can continue. Collection of scrap iron can also be continued with respect for social distance."
Are the recycling parks closed?,The rules for container parks can be found on the websites of the regions concerned.
Will I get any mail?,"Yes, the mailmen will keep delivering your letters."
Can I still go to the library?,Libraries are considered to be a public service and must be guaranteed to remain open in a collection function with respect for social distancing measures.
"Can we make trips to bottle banks, clothing containers, underground containers for glass and PMD?","Yes, that is allowed."
Should provincial domains be closed?,"The recreational areas of these domains must be closed (e.g. playgrounds, etc.). However, parks and woodland can remain open, subject to social distancing measures. This must be supervised."
Can road works and utilities in general still go ahead?,"Yes, subject to social distancing measures."
Are the municipal and provincial councils continuing?,"Yes, insofar as the agenda items cannot be postponed and if the meeting cannot take place virtually."
"Do the CPASs fall under 'the institutions for care, reception and assistance for elderly persons, for minors, for disabled persons and for vulnerable persons'?",Yes. A CPAS provides essential services.
Does the CPAS service have to continue organising food distribution or not?,"Yes, subject to social distancing measures, this falls under health care."
Are enterprise counters allowed to remain open?,"They must organise themselves remotely as much as possible and if absolutely necessary they can open, subject to social distancing measures."
Are there specific provisions for public toilets and hygiene?,"For reasons of public order and hygiene, we recommend that you leave these open or provide an alternative. The municipality must take the necessary hygienic measures."
Do the Local Reception Initiatives (LOIs) fall under 'asylum and migration services including asylum reception and detention in the context of forced return'?,Yes.

"What about self-quarantining after returning from an area/country of high
prevalence?","If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for
14 days after travel. During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention
should you develop any signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.
‚Ä¢ Self-quarantine for 14 days is recommended when you have been exposed to contact with
lab-confirmed COVID-19.
‚Ä¢ Since this is a rapidly evolving situation, many member states are imposing quarantine
recommendations for travelers, which varies by country. We suggest monitoring the travel 
advisories issued from WHO and DHMOSH for up to date information
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice and
https://hr.un.org/page/travel-health-information"
". I just returned from travel to a country/area experiencing local transmission of
COVID-19. I am well and have no symptoms. Can I go back to the workplace? ","For any UN personnel who are free of symptoms, and returning from country/area or
territory experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, managers are encouraged to exercise
flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements for staff in these situations who
would like to limit their contact with others and work from home for 14 days post-travel.
This is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.
‚Ä¢ Individuals returning from areas of outbreaks should be advised to review our health
advisory on this Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) page so that you have awareness about the
disease. You should monitor yourself daily for signs of fever, respiratory symptoms (e.g.,
breathing difficulties, cough), and know where to seek medical attention if you are aware of
any symptoms within yourself. You should monitor yourself for at least 14 days after your
travel."
"What is the protocol for staff members returning to work after visiting COVID-19
affected countries (i.e., those with ongoing transmission)? ","If you have just returned from an affected area, you should self-monitor for symptoms for
14 days after travel.
‚Ä¢ During that period, you should immediately seek medical attention should you develop any
signs and symptoms, such as shortness of breath or cough.
‚Ä¢ Remember to share your previous travel history with your health care provider and make
every effort to inform them by phone prior to visiting a medical facility and wear a medical
mask when you seek medical care.
‚Ä¢ You should only return to work when you are well and completely free of symptoms.
‚Ä¢ HR personnel and managers are encouraged to exercise flexibility around remote working to
support staff"
"I plan to travel to / have a meeting in countries or territories currently experiencing
local transmission of COVID-19. Should I cancel this travel/meeting? ","While the WHO does not recommend and advises against the application of any travel
restrictions based on the information currently available on COVID-19, as an occupational
health measure, it is recommended that for all official travel, UN managers and/or UN
personnel undertake a risk assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel
balanced against the risks to the traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas
experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19. This includes risks posed by both medical
issues and evolving travel/border restrictions enacted by states parties.
‚Ä¢ Please be aware that local authorities may begin to implement travel restrictions and health
screening measures for travelers entering or exiting the country. All UN personnel who are
planning to travel should check with the destination countries‚Äô embassy, consulate, or
Ministry of Health and keep up to date with local health advice before and during your
travel. You should also comply with any screening measures put in place by local authorities.
‚Ä¢ As the outbreak evolves, it can be difficult to predict the situation globally, and it would be
prudent to make contingency arrangements should the need arise. Feel free to consult us
further at dos-dhmosh-public-health@un.org as needed."
"Does the UN have any specific guidelines for meeting / mass gathering organizers and
participants during the COVID-19 outbreak? ","For meetings during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Division of Healthcare Management and
Occupational Safety and Health (DHMOSH) has prepared the following guidelines for
meeting organizers and participants which are available in the UN HR portal. UN offices
should use these global guidelines to develop local ones in accordance with host country
legislation.
‚Ä¢ The WHO has also released an interim guidance with key planning recommendations for
mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak."
What is the process for evaluating the criticality of official travels and meetings? ,"UN Medical Directors recommend that UN managers and/or UN personnel undertake a risk
assessment to evaluate the criticality of the proposed travel balanced against the risks to the
traveler for any travel to or meetings in affected areas experiencing ongoing transmission of
COVID-19."
What can we do if we don‚Äôt have any hand sanitizers in the office building?,"You should contact the Facilities Management Service of your local UN duty station,
organization or the building administration. "
"My colleague is sick but he/she insists that it is just the common cold and is reluctant
to work from home. What steps can we take to enforce ‚Äústaying at home when not
well‚Äù amongst staff? ","While it is very likely that your colleague is only suffering from the common cold or flu, all
precautions should, nevertheless, be taken. Managers should encourage staff members with flu
symptoms to telecommute for some time until the symptoms have abated. Alternatively, if the
staff member is feeling unfit, he/she should take sick leave. This is a sensible approach at any
time to prevent the spreading of flu or other seasonal viruses. Supervisors are also encouraged
to exercise flexibility in terms of using remote working arrangements if the staff member would
like to limit their contact with others and work from home."
"When should we identify ourselves as ""being sick"" and stay at home? ","Although a fever is a sure sign that you are sick enough not to come to work, anyone
experiencing respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing should stay at home."
Should I start avoiding people of Asian descent and their businesses? ,"The virus can affect anyone regardless of nationality, race and color. The Organization will not
tolerate discrimination and encourages everyone to promote culturally appropriate and 
empathetic community engagement and to detect and rapidly respond to negative public
perceptions and counter misinformation. "
"Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close
proximity to someone who doesn‚Äôt have respiratory symptoms?","Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody
who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of
the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1
meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and
practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation"
Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature? ,"It is not known yet if weather and temperature changes impact or has any connection with
COVID-19. At this time, it is not clear or known if the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the
weather becomes warmer."
Is it safe to receive a package from an area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of
catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and
exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?,"We know that for similar coronaviruses, infected people are unlikely to be re-infected shortly
after they recover. However, because the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood,
it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients who have
recovered from COVID-19."
"What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available? Can I use other
alcohol like ethyl or liquor? ","If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and
even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand
rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%."
How can I get tested for COVID-19? ,"If you are well, no testing is recommended. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you
should immediately isolate yourself from others. Call your local UN clinic/medical facility to
inform them of your condition and relevant travel/exposure history. If you had been identified
as a close contact of a case by the local Ministry of Health or WHO, please also indicate this.
From here you will be advised if a medical assessment is necessary and how to get tested. "
How long does the virus survive on surfaces? ,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to
behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary
information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several 
days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of
the environment)."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as
when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with
animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs
with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked
animal products."
How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19?,"The ‚Äúincubation period‚Äù means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have
symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-
14 days, most commonly around five days."
"I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What
precautions should I take?","You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and
minimize shared space.
‚Ä¢ Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to
do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet
surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and
then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium
hypochlorite.
‚Ä¢ Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and
water (if hands are visibly soiled).
‚Ä¢ Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a
distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person.
‚Ä¢ When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask
that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual.
Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it
should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and
perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately
after use.
‚Ä¢ Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after
contact with respiratory secretions."
"Until when should I wear a mask after recovering from an illness with respiratory
symptoms? ","In order to avoid infecting others, you should use a mask for as long as you are still coughing or
sneezing. You should only stop after a complete recovery (which means 24-48 hours after having
no symptoms without medication). "
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.                                                                              Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick."
I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask? ,"According to the WHO, for individuals without respiratory symptoms, a medical mask is not
required, as no evidence is available on its usefulness to protect non-sick persons.
However, masks might be worn in some countries according to local cultural habits. If masks are
used, best practices should be followed on how to wear, remove, and dispose of them and on
hand hygiene action after removal. For more information, visit the WHO guidance on use of
masks in the community."
How likely am I to catch COVID-19? ,"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19
outbreak unfolding there.
For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are
now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living 
in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health
authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to
comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China
and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It‚Äôs important to
be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the
COVID-19 situation worldwide."
"Are pregnant women more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus and will it harm the
fetus?","We do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of
pregnant women to COVID-19. Pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic
changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including
COVID-19.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected
person through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit
the virus that causes COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission
(before, during, or after delivery) is still unknown."
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19? ,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than
adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of
the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if
they have COVID-19 infection on CDC‚Äôs current Risk Assessment page."
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults? ,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with
confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in
children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and
diarrhea have also been reported. It‚Äôs not known yet whether some children may be at higher
risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special
healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19? ,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate
symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the
disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as
a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include
both western and traditional medicines. "
