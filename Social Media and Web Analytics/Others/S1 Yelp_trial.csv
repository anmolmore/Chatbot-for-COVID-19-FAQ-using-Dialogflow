VfBHSwC5Vz_pbFluy07i9Q,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. The location of this hotel and very decent price makes this an amazing deal. When you walk out the front door Scott Monument and Princes street are right in front of you, Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile is a 2 minute walk via a close right around the corner, and there are so many hidden gems nearby including Calton Hill and the newly opened Arches that made this location incredible.

The hotel itself was also very nice with a reasonably priced bar, very considerate staff, and small but comfortable rooms with excellent bathrooms and showers. Only two minor complaints are no telephones in room for room service (not a huge deal for us) and no AC in the room, but they have huge windows which can be fully opened. The staff were incredible though, letting us borrow umbrellas for the rain, giving us maps and directions, and also when we had lost our only UK adapter for charging our phones gave us a very fancy one for free.

I would highly recommend this hotel to friends, and when I return to Edinburgh (which I most definitely will) I will be staying here without any hesitation."
3zRpneRKDsOPq92tq7ybAA,"If you need an inexpensive place to stay for a night or two then you may consider this place but for a longer stay I'd recommend somewhere with better amenities. 

Pros:
Great location- you're right by the train station, central location to get to old town and new town, and right by sight seeing his tours. Food, bars, and shopping all within walking distance. Location, location, location.
Very clean and very good maid service

Cons:
Tiny rooms 
Uncomfortable bed 
Absolutely no amenities 
No phone in room 
No wardrobe 

Was given a lot of attitude about me and my husband sharing a room which was quite strange and we were charged 15 pounds more for double occupancy not sure why that matters I felt like it was a money grab. It was just handled in a kind of odd manner to me... 

If you book this hotel all you get is a bed, desk, and a bathroom. It isn't awful but know what you're getting into."
ne5WhI1jUFOcRn-b-gAzHA,"Mittlerweile gibt es in Edinburgh zwei Ableger der Motel-One-Kette - diese hier ist eher das schlechtere.

Wir hatten auf unserer Schottlandtour die Gelegenheit beide Ableger kennenzulernen, da wir beide Nächte in Edinburgh (am ersten sowie am letzten Tag) in einem der beiden Motel One's verbrachten. Von diesem hier waren wir nach dem überraschend positiven Erlebnis im Motel One an der Princes Street [1] etwas enttäuscht.

Das Hotel ist wesentlich größer und extrem unübersichtlich. Da man auf der fünften Etage noch Teile eines weiteren Gebäude, das mittels einer Glasbrücke mit dem Hauptgebäude verbunden ist, hinzugenommen hat, kann die Suche nach dem Zimmer insbesondere auf dieser Etage zu einem Gang im Labyrinth ausarten. Habe ich so noch in keinem Hotel erlebt - uns begegneten immer wieder Menschen, die sich auf der Suche nach ihren Zimmern verirrt haben.
Unser Zimmer war ähnlich aufgebaut wie das Zimmer im Motel One Princes Street - befand sich jedoch im Inneren des Gebäudes und hatte daher kein Fenster. Nur eine kleine Dachluke, die sich am oberen Ende eines etwa 3m langen Schachts befand, sorgte für einen minimalen Anteil Tageslicht im Zimmer. diese Luke ließ sich auch nicht öffnen, nur ein elektrisches Rollo ließ sich mittels eines Schalters öffnen bzw. schließen.
Sonst gilt für das Zimmer eigentlich das Gleiche wie für das Zimmer im im Motel One Princes Street: Relativ klein, trotzdem extrem ansprechend und schick gestaltet und clever durchdacht. Dazu sehr ruhig.

Im gesamten Hotel gibt es kostenloses WLAN für die Dauer des Aufenthalts für maximal 3 Geräte.

Die Lage des Motel One Royal Mile ist großartig. Vom Airlink-Flughafenbus kann man quasi in den Hoteleingang stolpern, es sind maximal 50m. Zur Royal Mile sind es etwa 100m Luftlinie (bergauf) und man benötigt etwa 5 Minuten bis dort.

Das Frühstück für 9,50 GBP / Person kann man nutzen - muss man aber nicht. Es ist eher übersichtlich und kontinetaler Prägung, trotzdem aber sehr gut. Für den gleichen Preis oder weniger bekommt man aber problemlos ein reichhaltiges Frühstück in einem der zahlreichen Cafes von Edinburgh.

Für ein oder zwei Nächte kann man hier problemlos bleiben, sollte aber nicht allzuviel erwarten. Hat man die Wahl, sollte man meiner Erfahrung nach lieber auf das andere Motel One an der Princes Street ausweichen.

llmdwOgDReucVoWEry61Lw,Location is everything and this hotel has it! The reception is inviting and open 24 hours. They are very helpful and have a lot of patience answering all my questions about where to go etc. there is also a lounge open 24 hours with snack-type food. Breakfast is continental-style so if you want heartier fare look elsewhere though you don't have to go far. The bus and train stations are right across the street so it's easy access to the airport or anywhere else you may want to go. Turn uphill to old town or cross the bridge to new town. The room with a view i got was spacious and comfortable though it's a bit of a maze to find it-just follow the signs. The windows are double paned so the room is quiet plus i was on the 5th floor which helps. It's a bit pricey but still one of the best values i found!
DuffS87NaSMDmIfluvT83g,"gute lage im stadtzentrum. shoppingmeile und sehenswürdigkeiten, sowie gute pubs in laufweite. das hotel ist neu, gut gepflegt und hat bemühtes/nettes personal. ideal für einen kurztrip nach edinburgh. längere aufenthalte eher nicht, da die zimmer recht klein sind."
GvLmUkjUrOyFH8KFnmT1uw,"Erstklassige Lage. Dazu ist alles geschrieben  worden.
Wir hatten Zimmer 718 mit Blick auf den Bahnhof. Ist zwar zu laut mit offenen Fenster nachts, aber der Ausblick verzeiht alles. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und super hilfsbereit. Wer Edinburgh zu Fuß erkunden möchte, ist hier perfekt aufgehoben."
lGEl24NGj2HVBJrodeXcjg,"Beautiful space, great location, staff rock. Tiny room, but this was expected. Bathroom amazing. Walls, however, paper thin, which is why I can barely string a sentence together in this review."
cUgvEy5wj7zYE68v1BzzVg,"This is a fairly new property I think. It is a German company and has most of the amenities you would want. It is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank.
Location is really good. Near the Royal Mile and Waverley station without being too noisy. Very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. Has WiFi but we did have to re-log in every day."
FSB_BnvysBgH3JYrbFNcgw,"First time at this group of hotels. Pretty new, only one in UK, another to open in Edinburgh and one in London. Rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in Edinburgh. Rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!"
dhl3ZW9aAEX_T7_um5tfaQ,"Location location location! 

Motel One is just right in the middle of everything. To one side you have the New town and the main trains station ( and right in front of the airport bus)  and on the other side the beautiful old town of Edinburg. 

The room was small but clean and with all you need. 
The bathroom was also small but nice and clean and the shower was big and good! Next to the bed there is a European plug (CC 7/7) so we actually didn't need to use our adapter. 

The beed was to hard for my back and I prefer the bed more soft, but I will still come back to Edinburgh and Motel One."
JQJvnM3p-3eML05eKcTgiw,"A hotel that has all the basics that you'd need - no additional fuss. For the price we paid, I'd say this place is actually pretty good value. The location is super central and it's easy to get to everywhere from here! It's also right next to the airport shuttle bus and train station, so transport is also easy. 

The insides is a bit of a maze depending on where your room is located - you may have to go down to go up to go back down again to get to your room! But no bother, it's good for walking off the chips and sobering from your drinks."
6JF4WfHgwYrrdZ2VeYtnFw,"Stayed here for two nights, costs was £109 per night for two people sharing a room which was not a budget price for what felt like budget rooms. Firstly they don't have any twin rooms in the hotel which would be preferable when I was sharing with a friend not my lover! There is only one small bin which is located in the bathroom.  No soap, which I find ridiculous, only toiletries were a dual shower gel/hair wash. There was a hairdryer but no wardrobes or drawers. Room was also very cold. 

Now for the positive, the location is very good, close to princes street and St. Andrews square. The staff are very helpful and the bar is 24 hours. 

Don't bother with the breakfast which is £9.50 each for a continental breakfast where you can easily get a cooked breakfast in any one of the cafes in Cockburn Street, which is adjacent to this hotel. 

If I go to Edinburgh again I will book a different hotel."
fbVYETRuWDw8QnpimpGMpg,"Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. 
Breakfast is ok, but not more. 
Service is friendly. 
No twin rooms available.."
lobj38NgaokqVseN8_nn6g,"I really do love the Germans. This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. 

Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.

Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.

My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. 

Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer."
ysfjtAWreLoy7um8WTb8xA,"Motel One sets the standard for budget hotels. I stayed at the Dusseldorf branch a while ago so when I saw one in Edinburgh, I knew this was the place to book. We managed to get a reservation during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and only booked a few weeks before. We did pay a premium over the normal rate but given the crowds in the city during this time, it was still a good deal compared to other hotels.

Staff were all friendly and welcoming, presentable and professional.
We received a room upgrade with quite a large room overlooking the bridge crossing Waverley station to Princes St. Despite overlooking a busy road, the room was almost silent thanks to solid double glazing. The room temperature was perfectly controlled with an individual A/C unit. Super clean, modern, uncluttered. Bathroom was similar. No slamming doors or noise in the night. Bonus.

Free wifi that works with one log in (doesn't require repeated log ins as some places do) and had decent signal strength.

The buffet continental breakfast was also a hit with fresh croissants, danishes, cold cuts, cheese, toast, fruit and yoghurt all well presented, fresh and good quality as was the coffee.

If I am looking for a reasonable hotel in a city, Motel One will be by first choice."
OF1ToqGAubsWGri5iad15w,"Had Continental style breakfast here a short distance from Waverley Station as I had half hour before a train home and wanted to try somewhere new. Motel1One is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. 

On entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. Wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct Scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.

I sat in One Lounge, had tea and food self served for well under £10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. With a copy of local newspaper in hand I really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons I came in.

Some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in German. On going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.

Hmmm, by the time this was all done I came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot Earl Grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. Great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.

Maybe next time I will endeavour to try food against technology!"
ByRzJ8rF2KJWLr-cUNU6EA,"This place is horrible, we were so excited to try it since I got a gift card for my birthday. We went in an ordered are whole meal and they did not except are gift card, because their system was down. Unacceptable, this would have been so helpful if we would have known this prior!!"
i5UwUPlQFPLcE8p2gPFwBw,"For being fairly ""fast"" food.. Pei Wei (pronounced pay way I confirmed haha) is pretty darn good. we got a few things to share. I had the Asian chicken salad and was impressed! There was a decent amount of chicken. Some more veggies would be nice, but overall pretty good. The steak teriyaki was great as well as the fried rice. Over all good was good! Nice, clean, and reasonable."
EyQyvTTg2jX4or9bB8PC9g,"I decided to try it out, I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free...
They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want.

I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!

I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!

p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!"
G-EFA005besj5uHsH0sQFA,"I'm not saying Pei Wei is the best asian food I've ever tasted, far from it, it's a fairly large chain that puts on the appearance of something more refined, it's essentially to Asian food what Olive Garden is to Italian Food.

With that said I've always had pretty good experiences with Pei Wei, the food although not spectacular is better than some of the overcooked chicken drowning in MSG offered by some of the local chinese restaurants.  the portions are good sized, the food is generally consistent, and the prices are really reasonable considering this is a corporate chain in some cases cheaper than the local establishments. or dare I say it's name ""panda express"" (which is overpriced crap)

the time before last that I went they forgot the tomato's and the dressing for an asian chopped chicken salad that my wife ordered, I didn't discover that the dressing was missing until I got home, I immediately called the restaurant and was speaking to a manager within 30 seconds. The manager apologized and asked me If I would like to come back to the restaurant or if he could have my address so he could send me a gift certificate. I decided to go back to the restaurant, when I got the restaurant I told the person at the counter my name and they already had a bag set aside for me, the manager came over and explained to me there was another full salad in the bag, and he put additional dressing for the salad we already had, and additionally he gave me a coupon for free lettuce wraps.(which mental note: I need to use)

I must say I was impressed with this manager, and it was refreshing after being in situations where a manager has taken back the bag/plate and essentially ""un-F$@k's"" your food and returns it to you.

Overall great customer service, consistent food, and a good option for takeout in surprise."
6PcJSGUBSLjt4VLXos5C4A,Sometimes the food is spot on and delicious and other times it is quite salty at this location.  Very difficult to get a consistently good meal.  Menu items add up quickly.
PFJmyZD_lNBa_Y3kbX1VvA,Decent customer service but the food was awful. It was cold and had no sauce at all. I was expecting it to be good but this place really went down hill. I will never eat here again.
_Qv1FQUToLrKMuG6pV4Gzw,"Super clean restaurant and friendly staff. FRESH food. Hasn't been sitting under heat lamps. NO MSG, this is the good stuff. I have to have the Kung Pao Chicken weekly."
s2mlqrFNaPEGtcnEu3EJ4Q,"Found this the other night.  It is the PF Chang fast food option and it worked perfectly for us.  Limited menu, but lower prices. Very basic decor, but clean and fast seating.  Lettuce Wraps just as good as Chang's.  Very busy, especially the take out.  Glad to have it close"
oiSzZRrbi3y01_wqU528ZQ,"The staff here is great and they're nice,  wonderful and quick. People were ranting in raving about pei wei, I had to try it.  Even good yelp reviews.  I'm highly dissatisfied with the flavor of the food. This  should be labeled Asian inspired and not Asian. I've tried a variety of Chinese restaurants, this doesn't taste close to anything I've had at other Asian restaurants. Their Mongolian beef  was 5 pieces of beef and large mushrooms cut into thirds in a thick sauce. You eat the rice to wash off the nasty flavor. My shrimp was thickly coated in an overpowering  sauce as well.  I only ate some of the veggies that take center stage on a meat dish.  The center of my pork egg roll was cold. The hot N sour soup was a much thicker consistency almost like that of a chili instead of being brothy. Worst of all was the price.  This was not worth it to us. Neither me or my husband enjoyed either of  our dishes.  We didn't even eat half of our plates.  We even refused to take it home with us.  If you like and enjoy what typical Asian food tastes like,  don't waste your time here."
4BPjRE9VI0HhyZzyyYv0BQ,I had the garlic ginger broccoli chicken and it was not very good. The broccoli was hardly cooked and the sauce was way to sweet. Everything else was great. I will give them a few more tries before I write them off as another crappy Asian restaurant in Surprise.
kznHtw1Qido_9GX6sDQPJw,"This review is based upon consistency of flavor and great customer service.  We came and there was an unknown issue that required a 25 minute wait for food.  The employee notified us, and although hesitant, we decided to stay.  We have been here numerous times before in the past years so we are familiar with this location.  The employee was apologetic and gave us a free drink.  That was a simple gesture but rarely do you see decent customer service anymore.  We received our food and had an issue with an incorrect order.  It was explained and the issue was resolved quickly.  They gave us a free appetizer.  We do not expect perfection, nor free food.  This restaurant cares for customers and works to provide a positive experience.  We would return again because they have good food and they care.  That is a rarity in today's restaurant culture.  Kudos to the manager for creating this culture.  Ordered- fried rive and Tofu, edamame, won ton soup, dynamite chx, and Thai curry chx"
HWRTVn3Lc-RwN6udv4WJzQ,I love this place i'd recommend it to anyone ! We always order it togo and it never disappoints! The food always taste fresh and is always ready on time! Definitely our favorite lunch spot !
GiEB_A-m9HuX521WQNbL8w,"1st! Place is not closed. There was an issue with legal workers in the franchise chain. Now they are back! Food is one of the best! Especially their chicken mango! Daughter is a huge PF Chang fan, so she loves this place also! Her favorite is their Mongolian beef, and noodles! They are always coming up with something new, so you may have to try them more then a few times."
GKi4i6qocIgaYcwv1_0zzQ,"Definitely not a fan. Coming from Orange County, CA, I have high expectations when it comes to Asian food.  Suffice to say that Panda Express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad."
OrhWg2MmCznwfKfjHKvuhA,"Pretty good, not great. Definitely overpriced. It's barely a step up from Panda and not worth the price difference. Not saying it was bad, but $25 for two basic dishes is a bit much and they didn't make the order how I requested."
QXWku_OB3FCj9VCZfUZwwg,I wish I could give 1.5 stars. Nothing special. Lack of flavor. The entrees were either sweet or spicy. The crab Rangoon were.....different. The filling had a mealy consistency. Friend rice was bland. Plenty of other places to spend 50$ on takeout. Save your money.
5NtaW5EwXK595kP4Ynnisg,Disappointed that on yelp their hours show them open at 1030am but when you arrive they don't open until 11am. Waiting in the car to pick up a large order makes me think twice about catering from here. Don't get me wrong the food is great as always but they need to fix this.
ai6O4UqqDqnjO7gfz6jBkA,"1st visit had the lo mein...delish!  
2nd visit had the teriyaki...fine if you like salt.  Ick!"
ZrvsD7PSyPolII3gp4-uHw,"As a vegetarian, it can difficult to find places with good options, but I love getting a tofu bowl at Pei Wei. The first time I had it, I had to double check because it looks and has a similar texture to meat, but it's great. I love going to Pei Wei"
p7OqbXTjwmIN_XYohB6TFw,"Typical big business chinese place. Slightly fancy but very average food. Kinda like a fast food place.... you walk up and order then get your own drinks etc. Portions are very small. Prices are higher than average.

They offer a few different vegetarian options but it all tastes pretty bad

do yourself a favor and also support a local business and eat at big buddha around the corner. Its much better food"
ukpjwnetF5wGhGrSXmPRwA,"I love Pei Wei since it's just a bit more affordable than PF Changs.

This is the first restaurant in the chain where I found patrons tipping the servers. Although I don't mind leaving a dollar when it's due I find it hard to do when they don't do very much, especially since it's more of a counter service experience."
mT6U5lujK_zIcIqux92seA,"Great fresh food and clean restaurant. Friendly and very accommodating staff. I'm a frequent visitor. This is a sister restaurant to PF Chang's, but without the formality or higher prices. Great place to eat if you want the same style foods as PF Chang's, but a more laid back environment without the need to dress up or spend more."
YxAxExTdWtdMhEb14RGFRg,"This is pretty good. My wife and I usually split lettuce wraps and an entree of some sort. It's convenient to be able to order take out online. Overall, if I'm really in the mood for chinese food I'm going to make the drive a little further out to Big Buddha on Greenway and the 303, but this is a good substitute as it's about 1 minute from my house."
ue6ts-gA9khywe76lEL1Kg,"Food is good and consistent and the service is always great. I've never dined in, but get take-out fairly often. I love being able to just say ""same as last time"" when I call it in. Not as good as PF Changs, but certainly better than most other Asian-ish places in Surprise. Be aware that they use shitake mushrooms is almost everything, but they are fine with custom orders if you don't want them. All in all, it's not my favorite place, but I always enjoy it every time."
WsTYqsyNyUd7xpwFrgwI0g,"The hubs and I dined at the Glendale location about two years ago. i guess we were hoping it was like PF Chang's....but unfortunately were dissapointed.

We discovered the Surprise location a couple weeks ago and decided that tonight we would grab a quick bite. The hubs ordered Mongolian Beef (his fav at PF Chang's) and I ordered my ""tried and true"" Ginger Broccoli and Chicken."" Of course we started with the Lettuce Wraps because honestly...they are just the most delicious things ever!

Tonight we were pleasantly suprised that the food was quite delicious. Although the dishes are EXACTLY like what you would get at PF Chang's they are scrumptous in their own right. The only downfall is that the noise isn't conducive to conversation.  I haven't been to an establishment this noisy since Buca de Beppo's...which I love (don't get me wrong)!  But I will say (on a positive note) that the customer service is fabulous! Something that can be hard to come by at times...

As for price....$28 bucks for the two of us including an appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. (coke and iced tea...with free refills) Seems a bit pricy to me but honestly....EVERYTHING is expensive now days. 

Overall, try it out...they offer take out too so you can enjoy great food in the comfort of your home....without all the noise! (or they have a patio you can dine from)"
g9yv-M3kvOQFPyJHCjUrdg,"Very clean and staff is always friendly. I usually order the honey seared chicken but decided to switch it up. I ordered the Thai dynamite and it had a weird, almost chemical taste. I will go back but will stick to my usual order."
fk8OI26dAhQfot46T_SXWg,"If I could give no stars I would. My family placed an order to be picked up and were told to be there at 7:20. We get there and I sit waiting for the food until 8! Nobody acted like it was a big deal when I told them and just said ""oh.... Well we are running behind."" Um okay?! We get home and they forgot to put the crab puffs in my bag. Didn't bother going back and moved on to our meals. My honey glazed chicken was average, edible. My husbands sweet and sour chicken was so soggy it was disgusting! Couldn't even eat it. My daughter loves fried rice and wouldn't even eat hers, it was so greasy. We all ended up eating PB&J's and it was 100x better than anything we brought home."
ld06EwR5YyutWxud9ude0Q,"I went to Surprise Pei Wei Restuarant tonight on Bell.  This was my first visit to a Pei Wei.  I was very impressed with the atmosphere, food and staff.  The chicken teriyaki with fried rice was DELICIOUS.  The spring rolls were delicious too!  Your Pei Wei location is my new fav restaurant.."
CxVx2FD73kw--RuzXL_RVA,I like Pei Wei overall and enjoy their varied menu selections.  The food is good and fresh.  Sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit though.
jJaU6pbKkYgl15P-5zfg3A,"Everything was good except Thai chicken wraps. Too much cilantro, absolute overkill. I think long stems is just yucky, cut them off!! Korean beef was ok but just missed the flavor I'm used to in this dish. Service is always spot on."
7M2GCeIba1uTJMJbVO7TKw,"I really don't understand how anyone can eat the food from here.  Granted, I am Chinese and enjoy authentic food, however I like good Chinese American food.  For someone who usually doesn't leave food on her plate unless it is really bad, I could not finish my meal because it was tasteless and below average."
pxs5biP-IzmjXZpoh-iVHg,"Went in for lunch with a coworker today. The small portions are overpriced and really aren't small-half would've been more than enough. 
We were served quickly and the staff was friendly! The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed quickly. 
I was disappointed with my Mongolian chicken. It tasted more like Teriyaki and was swimming in sauce. I had at least a 1/3 cup of sauce left on my plate after eating my food.
All in all, PeiWei's food will be why I don't return anytime soon even though their staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere."
DW0B2tlav4Z7T1DTzAL7kQ,"The food is great and customer service is the best! The Dan Dan noodles are dynamite but they come standard pretty spicy...  I placed a pick up order by phone and asked for them to be mild, but they ended up being  spicy!  When I got home and tried to eat them they were too spicy.  I called in and spoke to the manager and he took care of it completely and replaced the order for me at no charge!"
nI2rhDM2CgNazMdhiODoRQ,"OH MY GOD, this place. I used to like Pei Wei until I moved to Surprise and this location ruined it for me. They consistently screw up on orders, have huge wait times, and run out of key ingredients on an alarmingly regular basis. We just spent an hour waiting for a take out order (kung pao veggies and vegetable fried rice), which was twice the time they quoted us, only to be told they were out of WHITE RICE (how does a chinese restaurant fail to foresee the possibility that they might serve a lot of white rice on a Saturday night?!). I may have chosen to stick around the extra 15 minutes if they hadn't already had to re-make half my order after making it incorrectly the first time. When I change up an order even slightly to accommodate for allergies/dietary needs, they have to re-make it at least 75% of the time.
If the food was consistently delicious, I'd rate it higher, but honestly, it's only okay."
sb7iYaCc6ggpShtElkcwiw,"My wife wanted to try this place for awhile now.  One of her brothers friends used to be a manager of one in Colorado too.  Tonight we decided to try it out.

I placed my order online.  Easy process.  My wife went with an order of Chicken Lo Mein and I went with Sesame Chicken/Steak with fried rice as well as an egg roll and 2 pot stickers.  Total for everything was $24.80 after tax.  I drove down and picked up my food.  The manager their was friendly, rang me up real quick and I was out the door in no time. This bag was heavy as hell too!   Here is how everything tasted.....................

Chicken Lo Mein-  Only had a little of this.  Good noodles, good white meat chicken.  My wife liked it.

Sesame Chicken/Steak-  I decided to try out 2 kinds of meat.  They let you mix and match which is cool...they charge you for the highest priced item.  I substituted fried rice for white rice (.99 cents extra).  This was touted as soy citrus glaze, red bell peppers, onions, scallions, ginger, garlic and chile paste and sesame seeds.  It was just alright.  The flavors didn't really do much for me.  It was a tad spicy from the chile paste but overall it was kind of bland.  I had some pieces of steak/chicken that were a bit funky too.  I would definitely try out a different dish next time here...if there is a next time ;-).  The fried rice was good!

Egg Roll- Eh.  It was an egg roll.  Nothing fantastic about it but it tasted fine.  It came with a sweet mustard dipping sauce which was pretty tasty.  Usual fillings of pork, veggies etc.

Deep Fried Pot Stickers-  I got 2 of these things.  They were good.  Small but good.  Straight pork filling in the middle of them.  

Overall it was just alright.  I will say that they give you a GRIP of food.  The 2 entrees we got could have easily fed 1-2 more people.  For $24.80 it was a great value.  The food just wasn't the type of thing that  you would ever crave and keep you coming back though.  While I was eating my meal, all I could think of were better Chinese food places I have had before....wishing I was eating them instead.  It filled my belly, service was friendly and the value is definitely there.  I'll probably give them another try and order some other dishes to see if there is something I really like.  We shall see............"
j51qEbi4hMm6WHGlkt57xg,"Haven't eaten at this location in particular, but in general the prices are high for what you get.  It's nothing special and any other Chinese place in the city can probably beat it in the price/quality area."
fKCizCcgm5lrdh0fxnOplg,Always on point. I get the Carmel chicken.. The crab wontons are a guilt must have. And I love there  tea too. Ate her for two years and always pleased. Thx!
TGG8n3Cb3klpPdamJ88owA,I love Pei Wei. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is chill. The restaurant was clean and staff friendly.
hQCBUqXmVB2QuQ2MVv3Apg,"Came here with my friend today cause we were starving and decide to go whichever next place we saw. And we were very surprised at how pretty the inside of the restaurant looked. The decor was amazing. I ordered the Japanese teryaki bowl vegetarian style and it was amazing. I loved the tofu and the brown rice and the veggies. My friend ordered the lo mein and she loved it. We didn't finish due to the fact that the portions are huge. (we didn't know it was a like share the bowl type of place, and when we figured it out we didn't do it because hers had meat). But overall this place was amazing. The employees are very very nice! And this place is vivid and just amazing. WAY better than panda express. I will definately come here again, and recomend it to everyone!!!"
P8h9lk3qwwzaYgM4ueCeqA,Very consistent food. Definitely a second best to P.F. Chang's.
LP1OdCHa7DMVpbLhB4dgMg,"Service is fast and on time. Love the online ordering-very convenient!  Food is always hot and delicious. However...NO FORKS FOR TAKE OUT?  That is poor management. Either you didn't order in time or there was a problem with the order...either way, hustle your booty to Walmart and buy a couple boxes: Unacceptable!"
_laP3dAOE--w6JMCG4HFjg,The food was fantastic! I highly recommend  the lettuce wraps.
RMuW5m75o_5RgL2mTMfg2g,"Then we went to dinner at Pei Wei. Not bad for an Asian fusion place. Filled with senior citizens, but that's not all that surprising. I had the Mango Thai Shrimp, apparently, which was good. Right amount of spice in the dish. Not too heavy, either. Steve and Chris had their own plates as well, both of which looked appetizing. Not crazy about the moderate wait nor the fact that strangers came up to the table with unnecessary parenting advice for Steve and Chris."
9-mx4vAByTMxJDrLfNZZbA,"We use them to cater family get-togethers. Love the vegetarian dishes, especially the baked tofu- yum!  The Mongolian beef is a favorite with family.  When we dine in we always get the lettuce wrap."
FxAxYxj5SbiOtcK36bJxCA,We went as a family of 6 and was treated very poorly by the manager at the  place. The food was greasy (I guess most Americans would love it since they don't see the difference) The manager had the audacity to compare this restaurant with PF Chang which is equally greasy and bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to any health conscious people. To top it all its expensive. Go to taco bell or China Panda and save your frustration and your appetite. Just being fancy is not the attraction motto for me. Maybe they will train their managers to change the attire of the restaurant. I wont waste my time here.
0sRld5Hk0O6JUGKpPlWgPQ,I love their food. I have gone there multiple times and still think it's great. I especially love their soda machine.  The Mongolian Beef dish is my absolute favorite.
g9IdtJr5oVv4Df0nY_IPng,"We are winter residents and always look forward to eating here when we return.  Sorry to say we were quite disappointed with our Pad Thai orders today, so much sauce that it resembled a thick soup.  The egg ingredient seemed to be overlooked and was in big slices rather than smaller curds,  when I asked a server about the sauce he replied that it wasn't really sauce but that the rice noodles were too wet.  Either way, it was not a pleasant dish today."
i_g131Z2mXHBSSm5erJZbw,"Very tasty Chinese food!  The prices are reasonable and serving sizes are generous.  I really enjoyed the Mongolian Beef!

Dont forget to grab a fortune cookie from the bowl on your way out!"
pta_2pIbHJhx_XM1-rIHzw,All around great flavor and portions. Perfect for take-out always consistent the fam eats here about three times a month never had a bad meal.
Ty2JjQqEZrmbSO7eFwlyiA,"The vegetarian options are pretty good, especially if you like tofu. The restaurant was out of napkins the last time I was there and the staff was friendly. I would recommend the take-out option versus dining in though."
hZsxP7BZi8seJQRKw6hxEQ,"Pretty good food a chain. You do get a lot of food for the price. However, every time I have ordered online there has been a mistake. Sometimes they tell me they never even received my order when I received the confirmation email. Also, if you in during a busy time and have a teenage girl as a cashier, you're chances of having a pleasant experience with her are slim to none. This has happened to me multiple times with multiple different cashiers. I have spoken to the manager and he is always very apologetic, but I guess you just can't get stressed teenage girls to be nice to customers. I will continue to go here as the food is good for the price and they are relatively quick with preparation. Nice options if you're veggies as well."
1GVnTlLTCeR6Ew8z2D1EFw,"What can I say, I'm a sucker for Pei Wei.  When we lived in California, I heard the place was shut down.  Glad to move back and see it open.  

Take out rocks, call ahead.  They remember your phone number and name, so when you call they already know you.  They also save your last order to ask if you want the same, or to add anything to it... Nice touch.  I think I eat there too much! 

The only thing I don't like, and I think I'm the only one who doesn't like it, is the soda machine.  Only because I always get a soda after someone has pumped out some nasty combination of orange soda and root beer, then I can taste it in my coke.  Wish they had some filter system.  Otherwise, I could eat here daily.  Find me here at least once a week! :)"
lHZziOQQYBGuyx11nCGSnA,"Took the family there last week.  Ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, Mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad Thai noodles.  

The Mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.

Honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  Same thing with the sweet and sour beef.

Ordered the Pad Thai without peanuts... Son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  They deliver the pad Thai with peanuts all over the top.  Sent it back and they fixed it.

They brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  We said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  They bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  The wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart-alecky-ness says that he ""let us keep the spring rolls"" and ""didn't charge is for all of our drinks"" as if he did us a favor.

Overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what I expected with a $65 food order!!

I wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."
hUnVNj83RehIogPzxKkR9w,I love the food and the containers it comes in. We eat there sometimes and also carry out. My favorite is ginger beef broccoli! Thank you for the emails especially. I really appreciate it
wmoivnocytzFnsJaB-5RIA,"Pei Wei has become a favorite ""take out"" spot for both myself and my girl friend.  We drive a little further than the local Taco Bell - KFC combination fast food stop, but to eat healthier it is certainly worth our time. 

Yesterday, after our Silver Crafting Class, we drove the 2.4 miles and not only enjoyed a relaxing healthy lunch, but then purchased ""take home"" orders so we would have our evening meal in the refrigerator waiting.  (I brought my husband home an order of his favorite Kung Po Chicken with brown rice.)  

If you haven't give Pei Wei a try, stop in some time. I believe you'll enjoy it -- that is, IF, you enjoy Asian dishes."
ZUKo5tY7ZXqzF8-Uu0R8Rw,"It's just above average.  Portions are decent and cost was ok.  Got in and out fast by phoning our order in.  Good was ok, it didn't floor me but it didn't make me not want to there again."
l8cGGc6AaHCj8XomkYRzAw,"In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking. 

We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers. 

With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?"
kAA5n5ie00OFi0w0K53WSA,"Pei Wei is the fast food version of PF Changs. There's a long and interesting story surrounding Pei Wei and that of PF Changs. Let me just say that, a man named Paul Fleming (PF) and (Flemings) is responsible for many of the restaurants that you and I frequent. His ex wife and him went through a bitter divorce her nickname is (Flow) and she operates ""Flows,"" Chinese restaurants. Flow is Chinese and married another Caucasian man 20-25 years younger than her, who speaks fluent Chinese. Anyways, Peiwei's in my opinion is overpriced for the small amount of you receive for the consideration you give. In other words, there's no value for your consideration. Yes, I do enjoy the PeiWei Spicy chicken, extra spicy with water chestnuts, but at $12.53 for the water chestnuts and extra chicken, it's just not worth it. The rice is almost always dry and is cooked incorrectly in massive amounts, as well as being a long grain, not short grain rice. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
k53Lj6HucbPbqZWYNFoBsg,I love the lettuce wraps here. They are simply the best.  I order carry out often from here. I occasionally dine in.  My problem with the dinning in is the seating. It is always difficult to find a seat.  The place really needs to expand.  If you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up.  Other than the seating I like it. Large portions of rice and noodles.  A little stingy on the meat.
ULJhNKA4iikk9fVyvfPHqA,"Just dirty ... Sometimes I wonder why we come back here. At the register the girl handed me a cup. There was particles of food on the inside. I handed it back and said ""It's dirty, I'll take a different one."" She put the dirty cup back with the other 'clean' cups. I stopped and restated ""No. It's DIRTY, you probably shouldn't give it to someone else."" (Shaking my head)"
En6K7NF2Sqxjc3NKLjx0cw,"Hot,vegan,carbo load 
You name it and they have it
Pricing is reasonable  and quality excellent 
No disappointments here
Five stars for the food 
We try to stop by monthly"
uiSS0Hd9L4krCvwX0jMugg,"I eat regularly (3-5 times a month) at Pei Wei, usually in Scottsdale or North Phoenix. My wife's doctor is across the street from this Pei Wei, so we have been stopping in when we go to her baby check ups. It is, without a doubt, the best Pei Wei I have eaten at. It is consistent, they don't get frustrated if you customize your order, and the cooks on always on point. 

Wish this location was closer!"
z30Tv_MrQzEow6WjLFmtXQ,"This Pei Wei location has such kind, welcoming staff. They are so accommodating and hospitable. 5 stars, hands down."
EvlwP4hCwnFdQyUvC6RFVQ,"Pei Wei is a fast, easy, cheaper PF Chang's - and that's what makes it great! If you like the tofu dishes at PF Chang's, you'll love Pei Wei. The food here is great. The service is exceptional. And the portions are huge! I usually end up taking about half the food home with me. Also, compared to other lunch spots near by (like Paradise Bakery), it's really not all that busy. Of course, it's not authentic Asian food, but you shouldn't be expecting that when you come here anyway."
mgNBEZoEznL5VYGAUmyAWQ,"The problem may be that I lived in the Bay Area for 30 years. There, bad restaurants expire in less that a year.  Pei Wei wouldn't last very long.  We had the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken.  The beef was in a salty, sticky sweet brown sauce that rendered it almost inedible.  The Chicken had little spice or sauce, although the pea pods were fresh.  Think Panda Express. Food is not serve family style. Food is ordered at the register and brought (eventually) to your table."
UQ68U4Z2JAhuBMOrAv1AGA,"First time ever giving a review but felt it was necessary. I'm just gonna go all in and say it... Pei Wei sucks ass. It seems to be subjective, I know. But in comparison to legitimate Asian food, wheather that's credible Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc., I'm not sure how anyone can make a compelling argument that Pei Wei is ""good"" food.. The crab wontons are usually a sure bet at any Asian restaurant but for some reason it just always sucks ass here. Fishy weird taste that's contrary to what they should taste like and the sauce is garbage. Teriyaki Chicken was bland and shitty. Pei Wei Spicy dish was average at best only cuz of the sweet sugary sauce that masks the overall flavor. Now my girlfriend and I just feel like shit.. Why? Cuz it's shitty food. Also saw on the local news that the location on Glendale and 7th st. had 4 health code violations. I'm officially done with this place. Spend a couple extra bucks and go eat some authentic Asian cuisine at a family owned restaurant that actually knows how to cook real food.. Not some corporate food chain bullshit.. Thank you for reading and bless your heart."
wFP3lpVdl03_NxZoXL4Pzg,"The wait time for the food was way too long- 30 minutes for a bowl of spicy noodles with some veggies. I'm a guest from out of state but this is nothing better than my local Panda joint. They should probably let the customers cook the food cause we could do it faster. 
The food was okay but the portions were a bit big. While I was waiting for the food (+30 min) I noticed a lot of people just ate a few bites and left the food on the table. So much food wasted- there must be a reason for that right?? 
The bathrooms weren't clean, barely had soap no towels and toilet didn't even flush!! 
I hope next time I'm down here that it isn't this bad."
0udTI0_Iy32PVH5ASUjfpA,I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.
ylXGqKJWJkwCwO-mhKh12A,"Absolutely wonderful. This place is clean, the staff is wonderful and go out of their way to help you. They stay a step ahead of you and get what what you need. 

The food is perfect! I have eaten here many many times and it has always been fresh, hot, and delicious! I highly recommend this place, 100%!"
mUgMtcicQR39CJX9FCchTg,Service is a 4  . Very sloppy also the hot and sour soup aint that  bad if u add enough chile paste and salt and soy sauce the gentleman named pop he is the manager great service from him and this other lady did not get her name unfortunetly  I've changed my rating 2 times that's how impressed I am
nsUHkKb3vIdwd0x7egzBUQ,"Love the food but it's great at all locations. The customer service is horrible at this location. Only two tables were occupied at the time we walked in for a carry out. We walked in and they looked at us like.....really? Go away!! Someone walked up to the register and he just looked at me. I asked him if he was ready to take my order and he just kept looking at me like I was wasting his time.  No thank you, nothing. Just a hand to take my money and then a bag in my face so I would leave and get out of their faces. Really???"
M6qZU16SjXoyoLrmNENhQg,We are from the Midwest and are visiting Phoenix on a vacation. We stopped in this place for some quick Asian food. What a great surprise! I had the Mongolian chicken and it was great. Very similar to PF Chang. You order at the counter and they bring the food. I wish we had one of these where I live.
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,"I usually go to pei wei regularly and am usually over all satisfied.  However today did not go well . First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal. When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card. To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me. The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment. I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket. 
The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience. To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for? 
BUYER BEWARE..."
4RF8dMNBW-p2eTluPME_4g,Enjoyed the bright fun Mexican decor!  The food was delicious and reasonably priced!  And the margaritas were delicious!
ClgrKJ6dqiM7vSKJBJ2w6Q,I've been here at least 5 times now and each time is better than the last. I Iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. Service is always good here and on par with other top places in Mentor. I really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! Everything I've had on the menu has been great.
IBCTqmvwvd5ZqQhuvFDNXg,"Terrific service. The place was packed, but we were seated right away. Chips and salsa on the table as we were seated. Great food, big portions, fast service."
69kni-xG6qtg9y3Hq_zw5g,"Ate here for lunch on a Sunday.  Arrived around 12:30, and there were a decent number of customers seated.

Service was friendly and fast, food was excellent, and they have DRAFT BEER, including a couple of Mexican brews.

This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to."
rQOasxLFCDNWLNW27VHnyA,"Been dining here since it first opened. Wife is from tx so this is her taste of home. When tx folks come to visit they ask to go to Don's. 
It's very good tex-mex."
eGtRHSII_uNGVELSxjYNSA,"If you have a hankering for Mexican, head on over to don tequilas. Fast service and delicious food with generous portions. We ordered the Guadalajara special tamale and the pollo adobe and they were both delicious."
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,"Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there. After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer. We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job? They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive. If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd."
Dq7iR4uVsVWPfqKqaLtmtw,"I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately ""americanized"" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce.... So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... Just let the waiter know.. Hell guide you to a great choice!"
H4ecwTdoO_sjwELf62BjwQ,"Inconsistent service, average food.....I've had better at Chipotle.....

Won't be back."
0IOu6FA2x-rcvtXb8Xvheg,"Always the same old bad Mexican food. At least this time I did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my Fajita Burrito.
Why many people I know, including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me."
ysv7Ynllze9TV3GkzF0D3g,"Very good, reasonable priced . The Texas quesadilla with chicken, 
Steak, shrimp, onion, peppers and cheese was large and very good
They have Dos Equis on draft!"
CwiGJRzxJ0wOfgmA4yCdig,What a surprise!  The most amazing Mexican food I have ever tasted and I am a foodie. My husband and I ordered the table side guac.  Delicious!   Texas margaritas. Delicious!  Seafood burritos with fresh cilantro!  I will be salivating for them soon!  All of the food was so fresh!  You must try this place. We will try the Green Road location next as it is closer to our home.
DmVaJHiNO21faYMc74YegQ,Amazingly good Mexican food but they rip you off EVERY time.  They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up. Its ALWAYS more. We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time.  Its too bad they scam their customers like this because the food really is awesome.  Write down everything you order and be prepared to question your bill.
Oj67TGc1ZBWYzzZi-7dIkQ,"The service was ok, the salsa flavorful, and the food pretty good. They only serve pre mixed margaritas,  which is no bueno. I ordered the burrito fajita and it was great, but the kids nachos were bland and rubbery."
UR_LseKj5wZjLo-tCwwMIg,"We came here for the first time to celebrate my birthday.  We ate a ton of fresh chips in advance of the meal, the salsa was pretty mild.

I had the Chori pollo, which is a burrito with chorizo and chicken with rice.  Man, it was amazing. Hot and spicy with peppers, I took some of the huge portion home and ate it the next day.  

The service was seriously, amazingly fast for a group of 4, and they kept our drinks regularly filled."
5DOAfsOxp0zfhMjR2PdFgw,"Yum!!! I love this place! Come almost every Friday. Try the Chicken Chili Verde, my first favorite dish. My new favorite, Burrito Chipotle!!!! So delicious! Don't forget the margaritas!! :)"
SsVEwBJDgATGEtZSRhNCGw,"We've eaten here 2-3 times a month for the last few years. It's my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I've never had a meal I didn't like! The menu is so huge and full of options, even your pickiest eaters should be able to find something they can enjoy.

I love how quickly the meals come out, which is especially nice when you're on your lunch hour. The portions are always great, and the staff treats us like family each time we stop in!"
DTTZFF-izUvZbrmP_4b2Jg,"We have just moved from Austin,TX to NE Ohio and are searching for our new favorite Mexican restaurant.  We were greeted promptly and brought to our table.  The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was a little blander than we care for.  Service seemed slow, but in all fairness it was Saturday evening.  I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas which had pieces of lobster sautéed with onion and tomato wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was average.  My husband had the Burrito Especial with a chicken burrito and a beef tip burrito.  Hubby said it was above average.  The rice had a nice flavor with an aftertaste of tomato and cilantro.  We were disappointed with the lack of complex flavor profiles that we have become accustomed to while living in the Southwest.  Overall, we rated it as adequate to good."
loBnTqzypW71GSEsE8-R_g,Maybe let's work on the chili rolenos. Do nice large poblemo peppers like el rancho and you got me as a frequent customer. A+ on the guacamole! Large portion. Nice!
iDRXhARsx77_IpWhey58Gg,"The food isn't bad, but every time I come here with friends they overcharge us. We end up getting charged at least a few dollars more than our menu items should be when we check out, and it's happened on several different occasions. 

Though the food may have been good and reasonably priced (on the menu, not on the bill), we will unfortunately never be going back. Very disappointing."
6sX7YcBhK0ASD8kLdVdCnw,"First time I eat here I came with friends who told me the food was the most authentic Mexican food they ever had, well it was not for me since it's not really Mexican but Tex Mex really. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about either, I ordered a piña colada and the waiter spill it over me without replacing it not good at all, the place tries so hard to be unique and as Mexican as can be but it is just a caricature and a stereotype of anything Mexican honestly I was waiting for the three amigos to come out of the bathroom or something I despise decoration like this  and it affected the overall rating. Second time there food was not as good I ordered a dish that included carnitas in it but they were missing I told my waiter he apologized brought them in told me he was sorry but he charged me for them anyways even though they were supposed to be included. Not as bad as others but not great by any means."
oDOyMnSs70q3jSeCKkETwQ,"Amazing Mexican place!! Very tasty and reasonably priced. We ordered Molacajete, seafood chimi and carne asada burrito. The best!! Molacajete is a must try! This is something new I have never tried before. Service is quick! Cute authentic decor."
SgUSVEETtE_HcBmeKAsN_w,"Service is great. Food is texmex and very good. I wish they offered black beans, I'm from California where black beans are popular. Margaritas are great, I got a buzz from two. The place was busy. Mexican families were here  and that's a plus."
LWsWwahRBEPbmiSlrwA31g,"The first thing I noticed here was the decor, which I have to say I liked.  Of course, yes, I enjoy lime green walls and bright pink color washes, but that's just me.  

We had three little ones with us, so you can imagine that we were a little less than organized, but our server took it all in stride, which we appreciated.  He was also super fast; I think all of us were surprised how quickly our meals came out. 

As for the food, I feel like it's a little difficult to review.  I had never been here before and my Mexican palate is less-than-sophisticated, so I randomly ordered a plain enchilada and quesadilla.  The latter was pretty good, though I found the enchilada a little perplexing.  It was hiding under the sauce and I couldn't really tell what was in it.    

The chips and salsa were great, though.  And hot.  The one person at our table who can apparently drink tabasco sauce straight even admitted his eyes were watering a little.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals.  

I'm not in Ohio much, but I'd happily go back and try something else.  Oh, and um, I wouldn't exactly object to painting my living room lime green, after seeing how cool it looked at Don's."
mvThe_xt5r-nXwM4btoxeA,"With everywhere else packed on a Friday night, we wondered in, not expecting much quite honestly. 

We both ordered off the specials menu, and my husband barely managed to squeeze in his standard 'where's my burrito' before two large plates, overflowing with food, arrived in front of us.

The food itself was good. Mexican food can too easily be greasy, but this was not. The menu is nothing startling, but the classic mexican dishes were all on the mark. And there was enough left over for a second meal tomorrow.

Prices were very reasonable - our total bill, including tips, was less than $25.  Definitely planning another visit."
SzI_v454Dd6HmxSi-wSZPw,"i don't understand all of the high marks for the this place. the chips were not good and the salsa wasn't good either.. the chips were bland, old and not seasoned at all, the salsa represented canned tomato taste, yuk, the chix enchilada was flavorless, while using white meat chicken it was not seasoned and very chewy, it had no flavor whatsoever and was definitely something ""not"" to order. the  most off putting thing about the place is the filthiness of all the furniture and the fact that we had fruit flies buzzing our table thru out our meal. while el rodeo and el patron are nearby, and have far better food,i cant understand what the attraction is to this place, will not be back"
rwzyKNL1bA54asCoTGiQUA,"On a recent trip to Kirtland, OH.

Decided to try even though the outside appearance was somewhat questionable.

But nice simple decor inside.  Friendly waitress who gave good tips from the menu.

We both had the Tres Amigos.  Nice chicken, steak, shrimp combo."
1JgdQwRj4IrGaNfQIoxF1Q,"If you blink. You will miss this little eatery, squished into the corner of a small strip mall in Mentor, Ohio.

I went with a friend of mine from the area, who was treated like a rock star when he arrived (well, he IS a rock star), and that's indicative of the casual and familial vibe at this restaurant.  I didn't take notes - too busy enjoying the company - but I'm pretty sure I got a burrito and it was delicious.  Margaritas were excellent (this much I do remember) and service was quick and pleasant.  Now that I know that this place exists, it gives me even more reason to travel to the northern tip of Ohio for good company and eats!"
8sK2ci8cUOzRxKP1hpkPNQ,"Good food, great prices, large portions, fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for. We highly recommend you try it!"
z6wG7RrcONWJlxE8AJypeg,"This will probably be my last review of this location. I was at don tequila yesterday & the cashier was talking  to me but I couldn't understand so I laughed it off. 
    
He told me I looked sexy today and said something else. I said thanks and laughed so that he wouldn't be offended. He came around the counter and walked up on me then hugged me so I assume he was asking for a hug. 
    
He then whispered in my ear that he just wanted to feel my breast on his chest. Seriously....I don't feel like I need to wear jeans and sweaters in the summer because he is a pervert. 

It was very disrespectful and unprofessional and I feel uncomfortable eating there anymore."
NSBC7JSjUn3ru4vf3f21Dg,"Sometimes you need a little spice in your life. Don Tequilla delivers. The neon sign beckons you inside and once there, sit back and enjoy.

The roomy booths offer space for cozy dinner or enough room for your whole brood or gang of friends. Nibble some fresh chips and salsa while you ponder your meal options. The salsa is fresh with tomatoes, cilantro and spice. In case that isn't enough heat for you ask for the special sauce from the kitchen for extra kick and spice.

I ordered the chili rellenos hoping not to be disappointed - this gal spent some time in Arizona and loves her Mexican food. These didn't disappoint. Yum. Served with rice and beans with a drizzle of red sauce.

Good enough to want to return and sample through the menu -- several other items caught my eye - fish tacos, nightly specials, burritos with tomatillo sauce!!! 

The staff is friendly and patiently gives you time to check-out the menu and answer any questions. nom.nom."
wPGXLAQX0z7FVh1PhInyLg,"i love this place!

First impressions this place is a fun atmosphere filled with mexican clay rooftops and colorful furniture.  You get your chips and salsa as you sit down as usual while they take orders for drinks.  They got horchata here now, which is a + in my book, if you haven't tried it yet, i totally recommend to.  

The food came out rather fast and speedy on extremely hot plates.  The salsa and hot sauces there are bombbbbb. Ask them for homemade style hot sauces they make in the kitchen, it's different everytime you go in.  Some will leave you sweating and some will leave a sweet or an extra tomato flavor in your mouth.

The food i'd definitely rate 7.5/10. as i'm a hardcore mexican food lover.  It's nothing you find in texas or california, but quite damn close.  I always find myself coming back to this fun filled, warm, family owned place and always leave feeling satisfied.  for taqueria style tacos, try the tacos el pastor!"
5oLdxF5fJfwrCZ20XDFDXg,"Authentic. Delicious chips and salsa follow you to the table on arrival - food arrives on plates too hot to touch. We lived in the South West for 9 years and ate at many Mexican places ONCE, before calling DonnyTs our favorite. We have been enjoying perfect food here for 6 plus years. Very little turn over in wait or kitchen staff... consistent quality food and service."
BaqYuJH1oIMNayOBW_AqFw,"Why hello service. Don't let the lime green walls scare you, this place is all business. Seated immediately, the waiter came to the table immediately, and the food came almost immediately after we'd ordered. Boyfriend got a combo platter with an enchilada and taquito and devoured the whole thing. I got a carnitas dinner platter and I could only finish half since I filled up on chips and salsa and guacamole. It was so good! 

The only disappointing part was the dessert. We ordered flan, and when it arrived it was covered in whipped cream and strawberry sauce which I am not a fan of. The consistency was nubbly. Should've went with the churros."
0yqWd0USYSpaPI7zUW4JAw,"Passed this place a few times and finally decided to try it. I got the #17 on the lunch menu. It was a burrito  with eggs, chorizo and cheese.  It was probably one of the most tasteless burritos I've ever had. It was covered in what appeared to be some sort of franks red hot sauce, and no im not mistaking it for enchilada sauce. The side of my plate was a pile of tomatoes shredded cheese and a piece of lettuce, a whole piece not shredded. Not happy with my lunch at all. The salsa and cheese dip were average, nothing to go crazy over. Service was quick and friendly. The food came out about 5 minutes after we ordered which kinda scared me. I like quick service, but also don't mind waiting a few minutes for some really good food. Overall the place was cute, people were friendly but food was less than OK. I wouldn't go back."
pVpmE6BWfK6W-1Zvat94NQ,"This is our go to Mexican restaurant. The staff is kind and courteous and Javier is an amazing gentleman. Always prompt , fresh and delicious. Their mango margaritas and dos Equis pair perfectly with our meals. Very family friendly and great atmosphere. Really a great place"
d1y0PAqpOQ_Ml-xil4Pz6A,"Food was AWESOME. The normal tacos are ... well ... normal and typical. My wife ordered the chicken fajitas and they were very good fajitas. I ordered the burrito durango which was a 12 inch shell STUFFED with chicken, steak, and huge shrimp! I asked for it spicy... and it actually came with pretty good heat. The burrito was outstanding, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Overall, we'll probably be back."
yED_RnJWbt03uA2tW56zFA,Food is always great especially Tableside Gauc but today service was really slow because of kitchen. Waiter couldn't have been nicer
M8g0a_W1AcHxrOcyXG0paw,"We had a really good meal here, service was quick and accurate.  Food was definitely better than most Mexican places around.  Margaritas were very good.  Most of all, the place was very clean!  Would definitely go again!"
3v3S0lYInTbqeN-lBh9VNA,"Went on a saturday night on the first night of summer, and had a party of 12.   We were sat almost immediately.  Went there because they had catered a party of a friend of mine.

Our server was professional, and bilingual.  But you could totally understand him and had a cool accent.  Americanized i suppose.  They do not use a POS system but use an old paper check system...so separate checks becomes an issue.

They put tons of chips and salsa in front of you...the chips are super crunch but almost no salt, and the salsa was bland for my taste.

I had the el paso speciai; beef tip burrito and chicken burrito w/ rice and beans.  All came out hot but a little watery.  Dunno where that came from.  But I did ask for lettuce/tomato set as it did not come with any in or on it.

Kids food came out fast, they did have the world cup and that seemed to distract the waiters...but as far as Mexican food goes it was pretty good for Mentor."
bBkEPhdZhni_vzvTKFv-oA,"Your basic traditional Mexican style restaurant, never at in only ordered out.
Made me wait for a hand full of my orders when I came to pick it up..but super tasty. With a lot of hit and miss items in the menu."
Z8P9EK2sOgYnyG9jqH25Tw,Very bland. Salsa is like tomato sauce. Enchilada sauce taste like canned marinara.. just awful.
MjkZOjE7Wi5V7SjAhgcj-Q,"Been here a couple times and so far every time we've gone the foods been great, the service has always been friendly and the portions are amazing!"
2pfPmMCXr3KEdHlO7k_N-g,Tacos al pastor--delish! Salsa and guacamole was very fresh! Refried beans were super good. Service was friendly and fast. Beer was cold and the bathroom was clean. What more can you ask for?
V-YiU3DC3prLkOh1ByOUAw,"So, I thought the food was average. But what makes this place is the cool interior and super attentive and friendly bartenders and servers.  We felt like we were part of la familia. I haven't felt that way in a Mexican restaurant, probably ever.  Fajitas did not arrive sizzling. Bummer.  My bean burrito and cheese enchilada were standard fare. Nothing to shout about. The beer was extra cold so bueno for that.  Very clean restaurant."
nLiRNtABmKq5-Vu2jsJQKg,We've been going here several times a month ever since they opened. Some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had at absolutely the LOWEST prices I have ever found for food this good. Waiters friendly and attentive. Nice decor. Nice new Bar.
Z5l99h18E3_g1GLcDSsWqA,"I left Table 17 feeling very ambivalent. Meh as others would put it. Some things good somethings not so great but on the whole in between.

The room is simple, farmhouse chic: long harvest table, ornamental roosters and wooden chairs with cushions for seating. Sundays and Mondays they have a decent prix fix menu on offer or you can order a la carte from their shared plates menu. I went with the steak frites and salad off the table d'hote. Spinach salad came nicely dressed though the dressing was plain could have used more tartness. I had a few slight issues with the steak frites, the steak came closer to medium when medium rare was requested and was under seasoned. My accompaniment of frites (which were wonderful btw) on the other hand was too liberally salted with kosher salt so I guess I got the best of both worlds! The Bearnaise sauce sauce on the side was so-so and didn't do too much to perk up the steak. Dessert was chilled rhubarb with creme anglaise really lovely but too much sugar in the sauce and the sprig of thyme thrown in kinda messed with my tastebuds, I really should have plucked it out!

My server was a lovely affable gentlemen who was very friendly, warm and quick on his toes. I did like the service. But the food was so-so and I find that there are better bistro options around town."
Z3Fw292i0Eg8liW0DT1jsw,"for the time being, for all its worth, i am going to stick to the magical number three.  okay. lets break it down.

the service.  when we walked in the waitress seemed to be adept at being the problem solver, however, slowly this role for her, became more difficult and intrusive.  we were (ironically enough) a party of three at around one pm on a friday for lunch and there was not a three person table available.  there seemed to be only one three person table available for seating in general (lets give them the benefit and say there was 2 three person tables) and so we were relegated to a two person at the front of the restaurant decorated with a third chair.  not the best, but so be it; its one pm at a relatively new restaurant and i was prepared to deal.   i will say though, with no regret, that it is worth it for them to reconsider how many two person tables they have versus three.  if they are popular or getting to be, this is something they might need to reexamine.  the waitress seemed to be the only one serving (i would guess) the 17 tables that were almost filled at that time, and so, i can appreciate it was a hard go, but at the same time it doesnt excuse for me her terseness and impatience.  every person at a job has stress to deal with and if yours deals directly with customers, you should learn to keep the dealing with that pressure to yourself.  its not the problem of the customer.  its her job to figure out how to make that work for herself.

for lunch table 17 serves sandwiches, salads and a soup.  we each had a sandwich, a salad, a coffee or tea and the bill came out to be about 60 bucks with tax and tip.  not exorbitant and not cheap.  though im sure the quality of the ingredients used was high, the sandwiches felt like they could be made at home.  in conjunction with that sentiment i am eager to admit that it takes skill to know when to stop cooking something, to pair spices up with core ingredients to arrive at something special, and not any joe will have the wherewithal to claim he can do the same whether he thinks so or not.  but if you are going to charge me somewhere around 9 bucks for a sandwich (with no other sides except for a couple pieces of cauliflower and a sliced carrot - which were good, doused in some kind of vinegar or pickled sauce) then perhaps you should use dijon instead of yellow mustard, or applewood smoked cheddar instead of havarti.  its fair to assume for the general population that 9 bucks is a hefty price for a sandwich and with that in mind one might put their ingredients where there outstretched palm is.

that being said the sandwiches tasted great.  (one thing has nothing to do with the other should you be saying to yourself something along the lines of ""well then what the hell is he complaining about"").

the vegetables that came on separate plates alongside the sandwiches were  4 dollars each.  we had three kinds.  one was sweet potatoes dressed with chilies, toasted coriander, mint and olive oil.  another was called farro, an ancient tuscan grain dressed with extra virgin olive oil, cucumber, carrot, and fine herbs. and the last one was chickpea salad with celery, pickled red onions, rosemary, parsley and lemon.

i enjoyed all of them, but they were honestly not representative of their ingredients.  i dont need to have my dishes overpowered by their listed ingredients, but if something says its going to be flavoured by mint, fine herbs and lemon dont you think you should be able to experience that as you taste it?  i think so.  again, to reiterate, i didnt mind the natural taste of the vegetable offered, but if thats the way it will end up tasting, perhaps you should say so.

all my peeves aside, i am still interested in trying this place out for dinner; the feel of the place is great, cool and relaxing and as i looked at their dinner menu it looked quite tasty.  so perhaps once they get their groove on itll be more enjoyable."
hsKINx1dIKeFTDe-ZlCvgA,"Love this place. I went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. The food is really really good. They have a great cocktail list. 

We shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (I loved it). Then, I had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). To finish, I had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert I've tried. I am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! 

The service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! Our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in French as he noticed that we were speaking French. 

I will definitely go back there...I am sad this place is kind of far from were I live!"
oviMS8F4ACflGysxsXKmew,"Had a lovely evening last night at Table 17.  Great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before - bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of $50, just).  

Lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day - last night it was meatballs) - though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous - and our meals/sides were excellent.  Also, the food prices

All in all a great evening  - could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.   

Definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu."
SmH05C7YViVmVjaL4FpHPQ,"Table 17 is a classic bistro with a very good menu, wine list and cocktail list.

I've been many times for dinner as well as brunch.

Food is always consistent, have never not liked anything I have ordered. 

Dinner: have been numerous times have tried their salumi & cheese board ($15) with was good, not Black Hoof excellent, but still pretty good. Their steak frites ($21) consisting of an 8 oz top cut sirloin was cooked perfecting medium rare and served with a side of beranaise sauce. decadent and good. Have also had lamb here but it must have been a special because it does not appear on the menu.

Brunch: You need to order a side of their thick cut double smoked bacon. Its to die for. They also typically have cinnamon buns at brunch that are baked in house. My favourite brunch item on the menu has to be Farmer's breakfast with consists of a scotch egg (soft boiled, battered then deep fried egg), a terrine with toast and a small side salad. Surprisingly it doesn't look like its on the menu anymore :( Have also had the stewed eggs which was also good.

Note: If you are a member of Foursquare, check out their specials for check-ins, last time i was there for brunch you got a mimosa or caesar on the house with you check-ins."
wNe5wh4wXjdRfkb6agPyAg,"I've been here for a few dinners and brunches, and it has been a pleasure every time. 

The service has always been very attentive and helpful. For one of the dinners, our group had trouble deciding on dishes so our server suggested that we pick a price point and let the chef put together a menu. It was a really fantastic experience!"
H_rqSpDAvTIWRG2-I6nOzw,"Ok, full disclosure:  went here as a default because Ascari Enoteca was closed down due to a busted water pipe or something.  
Food was AMAZING!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers and 3 mains, as well as dessert and cocktails......thought for sure we would get something that we did not like, but alas everything was delicious.  To quote an obnoxiously catchy song from The Lego Movie, ""Everything is awesome...."""
-8AcVBM6o3v0dbXhCSBOBA,"We had an exceptional experience at Table 17. Chef John prepared an incredible fois gras app, the squid ceviche did not disappoint... the Rainbow trout was melt in your mouth delicious and we ended our foodgasm with the dark chocolate tort."
c62RkSBhA3kmqcyyFn6dIg,"Found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a Sunday. There was one table available luckily. There wasn't a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! And very out of the ordinary. Service was good too.

French toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. It's a delight for the senses, this place."
DMksEQKXo4s8Df59X6EvWw,By far my favourite restaurant in the east end. Always great food and service - and a cool and inspired cocktail list. Great for any occasion!
zxVqUWJbDRhjwLKTsCt5eg,"I booked the private room for a small wedding reception recently. We had 14 guests, the room was perfect. Booking was incredibly easy and they took care of everything professionally and quickly. We were even able to come in the night before and decorate.


The dinner was amazing. We had the family style menu, which included: kale citrus salad, buffalo mozzarella, hunters mash, green beans, polenta with lamb bolognese, braised lamb shank, short ribs... There was more, but you get it. Lots of food for every one, lots to choose from, and so amazingly delicious. Everyone stopped talking at one point, they we're too busy eating.

We had a cake of our own brought in, so we got to take the dessert from the menu home. It was amazing, so decadent.

It was a fantastic dinner at the end of a fantastic day. I don't think I could have picked a better place to host my wedding meal.

My favourite was the polenta bolognese. I could eat that for days."
UbL9dgEYA7PeL-47W6m3KA,"I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't really turned off, I guess my experience was mediocre with a little disappointment. 

The restaurant in itself is very down to earth with only a slight hint of class. The host and the servers are not snobby and seem fairly friendly in this Leslieville establishment. The patrons are mixed with both young and hip city dwellers along with older more experienced foodies dining out with other couples of the same.

I found myself here ordering the much touted ""Hot Balls"" but found it just okay. The only hot ball that really stood out was the Goat Cheese with a honey like dipping sauce. It was actually a pretty amazing piece of creation. The other appetizer we have were the ""Diver Scallops"" which were cooked to perfection and came with a side of really thick and salty bacon. Our mains were the ""Leg of Lamb"" and ""Wild Stripped Bass"" both were great entrees that did not disappoint but at the same time didn't have a great WOW factor.  Desert was a bit of a disappointment, not much of a variety, you had a choice between chocolate, chocolate, or chocolate in some form or another. We had the homemade chocolate cheesecake, which really didn't amount to much for my taste buds. 

The Wine list is very French and if you're going by the bottle they don't really have an inexpensive alternative. Every bottle is $50+ which can make for a very expensive meal. 

Overall the food experience was just okay with some ups and downs. But the real down of the night was the service, after sitting down to our table , it took literally 10 min for someone to show up to greet us and take our drink orders. The other downside of the service, they don't place the wine bottles at your table but at a communal table in the centre of the room, they're suppose to pour for you but I found that our server kept forgetting even when our wine glasses were empty. I had to reach over to this communal table to grab our own bottle of wine and pour every time which really kills the experience.

I hope this was just an isolated experience for us as I think this restaurant is a real gem in the Leslieville area. If you do decide to go, make sure you have reservations as the restaurant seems to get filled up in all hours of the night."
OrRzQ2F9vhKFB0idvvB_SQ,"I had a nice time at Table 17.

It was busy when we got there. We had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot.

I had the polenta to start. It was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh-so-good.

I had the short ribs as my main. The meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.

We shared the hunters mash as a side - I was expecting more flavour.

Table 17 had a great vibe to it.
The food was good. The servers were attentive. I'd definitely go back."
CLOqBbXZuKdcFG7meiGYMw,"We had the scotch egg and the tomato based eggs. Everything was delish!
While I prefer to have my bread toasted I understand it's not the french way (and they would have accommodated if I asked!)

The potato rosti was totally worth breaking the diet for, and comes in 4 pieces and is easily shared!

The americano was outstanding they use amazing beans, and I wanted more. I had on of their $5 mimosas which is something that would keep me coming back weekly if I could !

The staff are all super lovely, and the ingredients were all do fresh (you can tell these things)
A perfect brunch spot, no need to wait in line at the other two ""brunch hot spots"" in the area. 

Highly recommend this spot!"
AT6hOO-wA9TPfvWXcEJyaQ,my first time here. Very impressed. Food was very tasty. Our waiter recommended me the Trout and it was amazing. So fresh. It came with a side of vegetables and i got some steak fries with it as well.  The service was pretty spot on and we were always asked if  everything was o.k...which it was.
vYjLW5T9-uqpUv7K_jXtEQ,"Walked in on a cold saturday afternoon round 1330!
waitress Helen received us very warmly and sat us at the best table for two by the window in the sun with view onto queen st east.
We started with mimosas while studying the brunch menu.
Helen was helpful, knowledgeable  and prompt.
I ordered the seasonal scramble, which today was chorizo artisanal, and tarragon scrambled fluffyly together with country butter toast. Loved it.
My girlfriend had the french toast, cinnamon creme anglaise and berries which she thought was pretty good.
We then asked for a cheese plate which was only available for dinner.
Helen accommodated us with it anyway:
*Paillot de chevre
*Mapledale 5 year cheddar
*Ciel de charlevoix
*Monforte toscano pecorino
*Clandestin 
Great little figs stuffed with walnuts dry crannies and almonds
A good bottle of sancerre and ""Voila""
$118 for the both of us
will come back, loved it!"
OBIcZAxeCihJZeJpwcUCYQ,"I was very excited to try Table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. I was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that I walked in. It was terrible service, and I was very surprised to see this. The waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. We waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  The beef tartar was by far my best course. The scallops were fine, as to be expected. The broccoli Was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. Wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. We did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. We had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. An all around let down for a place that I had heard was good."
JQAM0HY2FM6XxL9yYCW8KA,"Had an enjoyable meal at this Leslieville spot. Menu is light on  vegetarian options but is otherwise diverse. The tagliatelle was al dente and did not disappoint. My pal ate the steak and frites and licked the plate clean. My pomegranate cocktail was so sweet and satisfying
 that I had two."
lJOWB2JeEsb6-z6-0e70Cg,"I've had the pleasure of dining at Table 17 on two occasions. One time we were a group of four and another time it was just me and my husband. The place is simple but beautiful - gorgeous reclaimed wood, candlelit tables and lush fabrics. It just feels good when you walk in. The staff on both visits were very friendly and attentive, and both times the meals were excellent. Their prix fixe meal is tremendous value for the quality of the food you get although just a heads up that some of the dishes are very rich, so go easy on the apps! (re: get yourself a nice salad if you order the short ribs or risotto). If you're feeling like a cocktail to start the meal (and who wouldn't?) I'd suggest the Bourbon sour. Yummy."
pasBQx813wC1fBRw8fsvew,"I'm going to ignore the fact that the service was off and just chock that up to the fact that it was the poor girl's first week, so the cocktail spilled, the flatware dropped and the general feeling that the girl was nervous as all get out didn't really taint my evening because the food was excellent. 

Our group started off with the polenta special, a strong recommendation from the friends that suggested Table 17. As I understand it, the polenta to start rotates nightly... maybe weekly? This particular night it was served with some seasoned pork and Parmesan cheese. Thumbs way up for the polenta, the pork on the other hand... eh. Didn't have a tremendous amount of flavor. But no worries. Our entrees were bomb. Fish, filet, sides I don't think you can go wrong, and I highly suggest grabbing things everyone will like because you'll want to start forking at your neighbor's! I was impressed this place had such a strong cocktail program, figured wine was where it's at, at a place like this."
WcgoxemFDJbv33uc4FLxew,"I love this place.  It's definitely a little pricey, so it's more of a special occasion place.  Love the décor.

They have a gigantic table in the center of the restaurant where they slice your bread.  Kinda cool, but it takes up a lot of useful real estate.  Another 2 or 3 tables could potentially be in it's place.

The ""hot balls"" were highly recommended by a friend so we just had to order them.  I can't say I've ever had anything like them before.  There are 3 different types:  Arancino - mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - wildflower honey, and Arancino - spiced lamb stuffed risotto.  A little expensive for the size of these things, but delicious.

I went with the fish (trout) for my entrée.  It was very good.  Nothing special or unique to report.

I was very impressed with the service here.  I've recommended this restaurant to others, and they've loved it too."
k_swPjZERWnqRbP0Fuu5uw,"Considering the amount of rave reviews on here, I suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at Table 17. Maybe it was an off night but I walked away with a bad first impression. So did my guests.

The dinner reservation was at 5:45 on a Saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. Still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. 

Our server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. Scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. It was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. 

Our table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so I ordered another glass of wine so I could enjoy some with dinner. That glass arrived 20 mins after I was finished my main. Lots of apologies but little else.

That being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. And the space is gorgeous. However, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. We all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. The Halibut was the best of the bunch.

Considering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, I won't visit again."
-4bMAu3ygzhG2VSn6ygyow,"Booked through OpenTable a few days before, for 8pm. Zipped right in to our table.
Had the marinated olives and Diver Scallops to start...wow! The scallops were fantastic, some of the best I have had here in Toronto. I am usually not a big béarnaise fan, but found myself scraping the plate. The guanciale was a neat change too (different style of bacon).

Had the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta for dinner, also fantastic. Well cooked and presented. Love the square plates.
My friend had the braised short ribs, but was mildly disappointed. Found them to be very chewy. She made up for it with chamomile grappa for dessert.

The cheese plate for dessert, was a LOT of cheese! Good size hunks of Ontario Swiss, Ontario 10 year cheddar, a blue (im not a blue fan, so didnt pay attention), a something else that was kinda gouda-esque, and wonderful creamy goat cheese. Plus bread, crackers, olives, honey and apricot jam. Massive. Took a piece of cheese with me to the car!
My friend had the chocolate trio. She didnt like the darjeeling sauce on the chocolate, so that kinda disappointed dessert.

All in all, i thought it was quite good, but rare occurrence in Toronto where i had a fantastic meal, but my dinner date's was ho-hum. We agreed though that we'd give it another chance based on the scallops alone.

The service we had was fine, gentleman with a bit of a british accent was quite good and knowledgeable. Too bad others had issues, thought our guy was fine.

Reservations are definitely recommended, was quite busy."
gWxIIqLHfD0Pomiu3LilpA,"I came here for weekend brunch. We arrived around 11:30 and there was no wait, lots of free tables. It was packed by 12 or 12:30 though. 

The place is cozy and inviting. It's nice enough for a romantic dinner (NB: Sunday and Monday nights they have a $32 three-course table d'hote, and bring your own wine) but relaxed enough for families with young kids. The chicken theme (in the logo, decor) reminded me of the old Bistro Bakery Thuet. 

The brunch menu changes seasonally, so the current offerings are different from the menu on the website. I had the scrambled eggs -- smooth and fluffy with pecorino cheese and mixed peppers. It came with a green salad and warm baguette. It was filling without being too heavy or greasy. My DC had the Farmer's Breakfast, with a hard boiled egg in this deep fried batter, with an assortment of Ontario and Quebec cheeses (including a yummy Brie), pate, and tiny pickles. We shared an order of rosti, which was just right -- crisp and hearty. It's chunkier than the rosti at Le Petit Dejeuner, but not as thick as the rosti at Richtree/Movenpick. For drinks, I just had a glass of the freshly squeezed OJ. They do have $5 mimosas and caesars. DC had coffee, which was refilled diligently. 

The whole meal for 2 people came to $40 including tax and tip. Pretty reasonable for a nice place and great food. Service was friendly and attentive. 

Street parking on weekends is usually easy to find and $1.50 per hour. 

I checked-in and unlocked and offer for $36 for a ""14 oz. (!!) Heritage Beef Ribeye with hen of the woods mushrooms and mint & orange gremolata"" for my next visit."
WAzEW9fg-zy_eHE3_kRKeA,"I'll be frank: the only way we could afford this place was due to a gift certificate from a generous wedding guest. However, the food was right on the money. Good flavor; prompt service. If you have the money, go!"
VAUqyws2WuYDvV3Uahx5Ag,"We were here for brunch a few weeks back - delish !  Service was great, food was fantastic, and as a nice surprise we didn't have to wait all that long for a table.  And a good brunch can't just rely on its food for good reviews, so the answer is yes, the Ceasars were awesome.  We don't really live in the area but our visit here was really good so we'll be back."
rUnkJt8Mm4OpvXzJac9P-w,"I came here with my sisters for brunch on a Sunday so there was free street parking. (Yay!). 

The decor is nice and the tables are well spaced out. We were seated by the bar area close to the entrance. They have huge windows which are nice but get in your eyes in the day so we asked the servers to bring down the shades. 

Service was decent but not the best since the restaurant was pretty full and they only had two servers. 

The brunch menu is pretty diverse and goes beyond the typical french toast, pancakes, scrambled eggs  with sausage/bacon/ham & hash browns deal. 

I had The Sloppy Guisseppe, which is a plate of a couple fried eggs over bolognese sauce and fried polenta and fresh greens with a vinaigrette dressing.  The bolognese sauce was really meaty and thick - delicious and paired with fried eggs, you just can't go wrong. The fried polenta didn't seem ""fried"" as it wasn't crispy; not even around the edges which made the dish mushy...but then again, that's probably why it's called the ""Sloppy"" Guisseppe. I would have preferred if I had at least toasted bread on the side for a crunch or simply just a different texture (the salad wasn't enough). 
My sisters had the Pain Dore, which is french toast with cinnamon creme anglaise & berries. They liked it and thought the creme anglaise was a nice alternative to maple syrup."
eAZDknO3E_za9AIGZjIDAA,"Had a very lovely meal here on Saturday. Came at 6:30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. The crowd was definitely older, I don't think I saw anyone under 30 in there. Decor was very woodsy and rustic. But at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!
We had...
Hot balls: lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. You get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which I thought was very reasonable. They were so delicious, I wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.
Polenta w/ Sausage Sugo: My affection for polenta knows no bounds so I loved every little spoonful of this. It came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. Polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. Good liquid-to-polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. Chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. We loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.
Steak tartare w/ frites and salad: Delish and flavourful tartare. The frites were incredible!! Get them!

Will I be back? Yes! None of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid."
4BEtZTKBXzska1oaB-mhAQ,"One of my favourite restaurants in the neighbourhood. Food is consistent and the service impeccable. 

The steak frites are the best in the city. Scallops, duck confit and short ribs are also regular favourites."
ny9M2uEvdrxPpIxZ0B5euw,"Literally my FAVORITE new restaurant in the northern hemisphere. I've all but given up on Toronto until finding this gem through a friend in New York who raved about it. 
Took my vegetarian children for dinner, and we had an absolutely outstanding experience. 
Everything from the friendly and funny staff, to the custom vegetarian dinner that the teens devoured, was spectacular. 
The highlights: Hot balls, Brussel Sprouts, Diver scallops, Tartare, and the pasta was so light and tender with incredible delicate flavors
Kudos.
We'll be back soon!"
elb_JjGey_SGKUyo91c8hA,"The first time I came to Table 17 was a little over a year ago. I took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. The moment I came to this place I was very impressed. 

Firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. Secondly, it has this very home-y feel and decor. Nothing felt overwhelming. We came on a Monday night. (To my knowledge Sunday and Monday nights Table17 offers prix fixe menu.) We all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! However, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. Their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. Unfortunately, in multiple occasions I've asked if I could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil. :( 

The only thing I found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. 

Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Especially their duck confit which is amazing! 

-CL 

PS they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them. :)"
RNiNQyQ78zvKunbP09ChJw,"On a stormy, humid night in Leslieville, my partner and I stumbled upon this welcoming looking restaurant with the rooster out front, and it turned out quite well.

Though the category on Yelp is listed as French, I would say the food is much closer to Italian if you had to pick a cuisine.

Right off the hop the service was questionable. Benefit of the doubt moment: it was after 8 pm on a Sunday -- which in Toronto means you're lucky if anything half-decent is open at all -- and the place seemed  understaffed. 

Still, having to stand awkwardly for 10-15 min in the non-foyer, while  waiters whisked by us was not too pleasant.

And once we had a table, service continued to be spotty. Our waiter was friendly and self-effacing, calling us his ""little neglected table."" This was not inaccurate as even getting our initially requested waters (it was sweaty out!) took nearly 10 minutes, and later he left us with dessert menus for 20 minutes before coming back to see what we wanted, our appetites for anything sweet having seriously waned.

Food-wise though, things were great. We weren't terribly hungry, and so avoided the table d'hote fixed price menu going with the ""shared food"" section on the left column of the menu. It's a limited selection here, and we ordered about half of the available items, and were not disappointed. 

Rich white polenta, brought out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by an aproned chef who ladled a ""sugo"" of veal, zucchini and fresh basil on top. It was heart-warming, subtle and delicious, as well as a generous portion for two to share.

Alongside the polenta we had two smallish ramekins. One contained ""sauce & balls"" a cheekily named but very tasty take on classic meatballs in tomato sauce. The other had what was possibly my favourite dish of the night, a simple roasted beet preparation with blue cheese. The multicoloured heirloom beets were ""al dente"" but tender and went amazingly well with the semi-melted cheese.

Wines were great as well. My glass of Rollegrosse red ($11) was smooth beyond even the menu description, and my companion's ""Anna 6"" white was very dry and very refreshing. 

In addition to the service problems, my one other issue was the post-prandial whiskey, a single malt ($13) that came in a far-too large glass (we were informed the kitchen was ""out"" of snifters...) and which I found harsh and not to my liking. But that could be a matter of taste.

Total cost of meal for two: $77 + tip.
This would increase to over $100 easily if you go with the $30 table d'hote option + drinks.

I would happily give this place another shot, hopefully on day where service was at full steam. Until then I can't give it more than three stars out of five."
v79TP4gkdC3ud0y9YjoFSA,"Food: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 8/10 
Service: 9.5/10
Overall experience: 9/10

A lovely experience overall. Went and ordered:
- foie gras appetizer
- polenta (main #1)
- pasta special

All the food was great. You could tell it had been prepared with great care and came out piping hot.

The service was also fantastic. The server was extremely helpful in selecting a wine, and providing recommendations on the menu. We didn't feel pressured at all during the meal to hurry up or order more AKA increase the bill amount.

THE BOTTOM LINE: wonderful food, and equally as wonderful service."
y-ARDKgXj26RjFm7AhoCdg,"We went on a Travelzoo coupon and we arrived early for our 7:30 reservation. No problem, here's your table. Our server was fantastic! I can't remember his name, unfortunately. He made excellent suggestions, was very helpful, knew all the dishes, and the ingredients.
We had the Beef Carpaccio and Squid Ceviche in Gozpacho to start and were blown away by both!
 My wife was really looking forward to the lamb shank, which was not on that days' menu, so our server suggested the Venison loin. My wife had never had venison, so it took a little convincing, but she loved it.  It was probably the best venison I've ever tasted. I had the polenta with the wild boar sugo. very good. We also ordered the Roasted Jerusalem Artichokes, which were fantastic. 
The wine was very good, and dessert was excellent, Maple Panna Cotta and Sticky Toffee Pudding.
 All in all an excellent dining experience."
ndqc1YQPz3kTYbJIFORrdw,"This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night."
K2BYOl6veq4_aykdrDqSYw,"We were back here this evening.  Delish!

I ordered the beef tartare - it was pretty tasty, large enough to share as beef tartare is both an acquired taste and fairly rich on it's own.  My main was the leg of lamb, it was a little well done for my liking, but the flavour was quite nice - the morel mushrooms were loaded with a burst of buttery flavour.  

My bf started with scallops, they were quite large for scallops, and quite nice, and had a white fish, not trout, maybe halibut, that was also quite delish.  I love the decor, and upon reading other reviews am super sad that I missed out on a group on!  It was wonderful anyway, and I think a great place to dine.  

We went for an early seating (a bit before 6), and I'm happy to report, that next time, I'll either go for another early seating or something later (after 9 in the evening), as it can get quite loud, and that makes it hard to hear your dining companion!"
mP2j4QGj72q5VM-teKKcgg,"Love this restaurant!!! Awesome brunch, $10 for anything on the menu. My hubby doesn't get super full off of the stuff, but I'm good with the amount. Awesome decor too!!"
WaS0TdcqyAN-T4C_N0X9RQ,We went here for Mother's Day brunch.  I had a very good egg omelette with guacamole and my wife had the French toast. Very nice intimate setting and the menu has very nice choices.  We got our son a fresh berry yogurt which I ended up eating most of it because it was so good. My son was still quite happy regardless. We will definitely be back to claim our check in deal but that is not what would bring us back. The exciting dinner menu is why we will be back soon.
vv4S6OxIfBGbLTu_qxjMVA,"We had a great time. Dinner for 4 - with a healthy amount of food (or unhealthy - depends on how you look at it).

The polenta had their ""reindeer sauce"" which consisted of venison, spices, and berries. Delicious. 

Oysters were tasty, and the braised pork was unbelievably good. No idea what they used for aromatics - but there was a hint of fennel that was incredible. 

$400 for 4 people and drinks. Not a value dinner, but enjoyable, and guarantees my return. 

Oh. Peanut Butter Panna Cotta. Order it and thank me later. Servers were hilarious, attentive, and accommodating. I just can't see anything wrong with this place."
0IeuJHDMwJxHPMMs-Bt0BA,"I left Table 17 as pleased as could be last weekend- indulging in the very reasonably priced Sunday night table d'hôte we enjoyed the scallops, salted cod, polenta, boar sausage, panna cotta and gingerbread cookies with eggnog (!) We were particularly wowed by the boar but the entire meal was fabulous.

As a big bonus the place is BYOB with no corkage fees for one or two bottles.

A couple other reviewers noted a lack of attentiveness on the part of the servers- I would contend that our experience was the complete opposite of this. The server was charming, present and exceedingly helpful. Maybe this can be racked up to visiting on an early December Sunday evening? In any case, it was exactly what I was hoping for and more."
8pDkQMl1UYO7goTuKHDaNw,"I wish I could share Avitania B.'s Groupon enthusiasm because I found this place a big let down. I too had a $50 Groupon here and was really excited to give it a try. 

At first I was concerned that this place may be too fancy and romantic for a casual dinner with a friend, but the other patrons made that problem go away fast! Picture It's 9pm and you are trying to enjoy your meal next to four tables of three super loud middle-aged women who are all gossipping and complaining about their ""first-world problems"": She only got a 1.5 karat ring... I hate it when my maid doesn't iron the cuff on my pants... blah blah blah. I honestly wanted to tell them to all shut up. This is by no means the restaurant's fault but killed the ambiance for sure.

The food itself was good but the portions are quite small. I also found the menu selection to be minimal with only 6 entrees to choose from including a super tasty but super small bowl of pasta with wild mushrooms for $18.

I found the service friendly but very slow and inattentive. At times I felt as though I might need a bell to get the waiter's attention."
kJsYjLDPMO4b65NX3-ocYQ,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love that they aren't over-priced (not cheap either, mind you) and that they can usually manage to squeeze you in at the end of the service without a reservation (I'm a late eater.) The appetizers are where it is at here!"
VyDNI9gAjAcTnSgW_Y4OBQ,"Had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. I had the Sloppy Giuseppe - Two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of Bolognese sauce. Awesome. I'll definitely be back for that alone."
1goCEpy95A_Vxyo-IT1Yag,"Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.

Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.

I've been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.

Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.

The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as ""Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue""?! 

Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. 

Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can't see why I wouldn't return to Table 17, for a special occasion. 

This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself."
EGHciRl1EuEL16fXNvrFfg,"Brunchy time and we have a winner.  To start, we got a seat right away on Sunday for brunch.  I highly suggest going around 11:30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  It is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.

For my meal, I had the french toast.  It was good - light and perfectly cooked.  The cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  There was an assortment of berries as well.  Their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. 

Definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!"
enYFb4pnwyarggyWSbCAVA,"What an experience: from the shabby-chic decor, to the wonderful service, Table 17 was an all-around treat. 

First off the ""hot balls"" ( I know, I know), were phenomenal: arancini stuffed with risotto, another with goat cheese, and finally the crab. Each came with their own dipping sauce: amaaazing.

For dinner, the lamb tenderloin with a parsnip puree was cooked to perfection, a friend ordered the steak frites (delish), the beef tartare was tender and spicy and you can't really go wrong with an arugula salad, which was fresh and tasty. The presentation of the halibut wrapped in ramps (mild leek), was a show-stopper (as was the pomegranate mojito). 

Great place for a date, for a nice celebration, or just a nice culinary experience."
dNrRyGjK9ur9UBZGMeBWyA,"Was here for my first time just last week. Loved it. It was highlighted by the Soft Shell Crab and the Hunter's Mash. Also tried my first pint of Chambly on a recommendation from the bartender. I will be hunting this beer down in other restaurants I visit. 
Also, they are very quick to respond to any questions you have via Twitter."
pTq1ez9s0SNxaSlSxLBGGg,"Bottom line: great food, cute place, fabulous dinner. Would definitely go again. On the pricier side for the neighbourhood, but nothing ridiculous. Remember to make a reservation.

Went to Table 17 for dinner last night. My dinner date and I stupidly didn't think to make a reservation at 7:15 on a Saturday night (dumb, I know). So I definitely recommend a reservation. He had been to Table 17 before, I had not. Of course there were no tables when we arrived, but the staff were more than happy to seat us at the bar, which was thankfully empty when we arrived. Usually not a fan of having a nice dinner at the bar, but the barman managed to do a good job of staying out of our face, but being attentive at the same time. Of course the seat wasn't the comfiest, but that was our fault.

Food:
The server/ bartender made sure we knew all the daily specials and even recommended a few and took our drink orders (just beer). He also brought us a basket of bread, though it almost wasn't necessary because our appetizer came quickly.

To start we shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad (arugula) with spiced pumpkin puree and honeycomb - yum! My date wasn't too sure about the honey at first, but actually really liked it, was a nice flavour with the mozzarella. The warm pumpkin  with the cheese was my fave part - so delish. 

For my main I chose the pasta. It was capellini (I think, can't quite recall)...with gorgonzola cheese, roasted hazelnuts and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few ingredients. It was awesome - great mix of flavours and the pasta was cooked perfectly and served hot. I was skeptical about the hazelnuts at first but they were a great compliment to the gorgonzola. The portion was pretty big for this type of place, so my date had a bit of my pasta too and he also thought it was yum.

My date had the beef short ribs and said they were excellent and that the meat was falling off the bone. (As someone who does not eat beef or pork I was assured this was a good thing ha). It came with root vegetables and parsnip puree. Just as we were digging in our server brought a little bowl with extra root vegetables because the chef had suddenly realized my date didn't get enough. Once he pointed it out we realized there were only like 3 mini veggie cubes in his dish so it was nice that the staff noticed before we even did. 

We contemplated getting dessert for a minute, but were pretty stuffed. Maybe next time I'd skip the appetizer and try a dessert.

Only main downfall was sitting at the bar, it's not the comfiest to sit on a stool and it felt a bit crowded when other patrons were seated at the bar. It was also a little chilly/breezy as it's near the door and it was cold out. But that was our own fault.

Not sure what the total bill was in the end for the 2 drinks, appetizer and two mains, but our mains were around $20-25, some on the menu were a little pricier.

Overall great food, good service, cute place, fairly priced (though pricier than some of the other places in the neighbourhood). Definitely recommend."
SQrS_X4z4_HolRUZ-9rHfQ,If you want to have a more quiet place to meet up with your spouses parents for the first time - that's the place to go on a Saturday morning. Make sure to come early as they don't accept reservations for less than groups of 6!!
CWOGe1a0q-FR_ofzEt-MEQ,"We really enjoyed this place.  Food and service was excellent.  Table 17 has different and unique things to try! I highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!!"
F7SZgPC5chCn4DItevIJGg,"I went here for the brunch the other day in this little bistro-style restaurant in Leslieville and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. 

The restaurant itself has a really cool decor - very minimal but rustic decor, brown paper tablecloths, quaint, romantic tables and nice, high ceilings. I couldn't get over how much personality the restaurant has, especially considering how new it is. 

And obviously its age has no affected its popularity. The place was packed at about 1 pm on a saturday. But considering how tasty the food was, I was surprised how busy it was. I ordered a mimosa and the toritilla - a sort of spanish-style dish that takes eggs, potatoes, cheese and bakes it into some quiche-type thing. It was served with a fresh tomato dip and some greens and it was absolutely delicious. I also sampled my boyfriends cheese plater, toasts with a variety of cheese and fruit, and it was also very tasty. 

Maybe it's because it's new, but the service was the one thing that didn't make this a 5 star occasion. Our waitress was slow, took forever to take our order and then forgot what we wanted. But the food was so good that it didn't ruin the experience."
bqJP8gO-f2OadqqdXFdhPw,"Great decor, great food, great drinks.
Food was really good, not a huge selection on the menu, but it was also a set menu for the night, so can't comment on the normal menu. Food was very tasty, and there was a very different selection of draft beer, all ones I hadn't heard of, but the one I tried was very good. Will definitly be going back!"
650QSmmJ_MaF4WN1V_gFZA,"""Table 17 is the rare restaurant that's both a neighbourhood hangout and a culinary destination,"" is the opening line as you land on their homepage, a quote from Toronto Life from 2013.  That's a tall order to fill and sets the standards high.

I wasn't a fan of Table 17 back then and I'm not surprised that my most recent dining experience was no different.  It satisfies the former part of the claim (being a neighbourhood hangout) but is far from being a culinary destination.

The kitchen seems to work along at its own pace which errs on the side of slow while servers try their hardest to service the two-roomed restaurant.  While I wouldn't say they're under-staffed I often found myself turning my head in all directions to flag our server down.

A meal at Table 17 errs on the side of pricey and while I have had many expensive meals in my lifetime as a food blogger; this one definitely errs on the side of overrated.

I've always lived by the mantra that if a restaurant's bread was not up to snuff that it would be an omen of the meal to follow.  Such was the case with the baguette sloppily appearing at our table; one has to ask for the communal balsamic vinegar and olive oil bottles because the servers can't be bothered to offer it.


Oysters come with a trio of condiments;  two mignonettes and the standard horseradish.

We opt for the halibut ceviche which, with its pretty plating is a disappointment as it turns out to be bland and flavorless.  The saving grace are the pea shoots, flavored with a peanut, chili and lime vinaigrette that is stellar and full-flavored.  I would happily eat a plate full of that as an appetizer.

For our mains we settle on an Ontario leg of lamb; which came deboned and served atop a bed of fava beans, roasted spring onion and butter poached black trumpet mushrooms.   Our table of 3 simultaneously shared a single thought - where's the rest of it?  To add insult to injury, the lamb was lukewarm (and the reason was in no way attributed to my occupational hazard of photographing the dish).

The Lake Erie pickerel is equally disappointing as we begin to pick at our food by this point.  The radish fennel & grapefruit ""salad"" which to me resembles more of a slaw is bland and lacking oomph.

Our dinner suddenly finds salvation in the Spaghetti Al Anatra; its texture loosely reminding me of ramen cooked to a perfect al dente as the duck confit does its magic at flavoring the dish.  The crispy duck skin is a little scant but we happily devour the noodles.

Side dishes are available à la carte and we opt for the sautéed kale.  It's nothing to write home about but gives us our daily dose of vegetables.

As with most things, what goes up must come down and in aviation-speak our dinner had a hard landing.  A dark chocolate torte that was reminiscent of a two-bite brownie drizzled in cheap store-bought chocolate sauce with some berries thrown on top.  The Panna-Colada was equally pedestrian as it loosely resembled those cheap complimentary desserts you'd get at the end of a Chinese dinner - all gelatin and not much else.

The message at the end of the day is - don't let the appearances at Table 17 fool you.  While everything looks great from the outside, the experience lacks substance.

Our meal with 2 glasses of wine and 3 coffees came just shy of $300.  Suffice it to say, this will be the last time I dine at Table 17."
cYuLXekMwyxb7bCNes-JdQ,"Stopped in right after lunch shift for a couple drinks. Bar tender was really helpful, friendly, and made for a great weekend afternoon drink. That said, they were definitely on the pricey end."
Bxxq3FoDgeyCN94P_dje_w,"Great service, the food and drinks were a miss.

Limited menu so we went with the waiter's recommendations. The hot balls we were excited to try. 1/3 made the grade. Each hot ball is something different, fried risotto, goat cheese or crab croquette with its unique dipping sauce. Loved the goat cheese and honey, the other two were okay.

POLENTA - served hot on a board with a duck confit topping, pepper and parmesan cheese. The far and away highlight of the meal. Came served on a board with a few sprigs of fresh basil and the chef served the topping at the table. Could have eaten this for dinner alone and left very impressed.

Mains were lamb striploin with a ratatouille and a steak with the bone left on. Both were disappointing. The steak was very tough and overdone. The lamb was tender but lacked flavor and the sides seemed to be leftover add-ons. 

The recommended Malbec was spot on. The decor was interesting, low lighting and some strangely heavy music detracted from the atmosphere.

Overall, I'd have to be convinced to go back. Maybe if someone promised me I could get two polenta and some wine."
fdsak3Yi-XGcD4GCeMvpOw,"I went here with a group of 4 late on a friday night at around 9:30 pm. We had a bottle of wine, foie gras, risotto, the ribeye, and a few other sides. Everything was perfect. Service was great. Prices were not cheap, but worth every bit. This is a place is good for 2 to 4 people who don't mind sharing some delicious plates and paying for quality."
rlEsmhITN6zfzHWepYuT0g,"PEI oysters with the lime-tequila sauce were great.  The menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise I was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. However, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good."
Xn3eG_RukBlHubUivYT85g,"Had a travelzoo voucher for this place. Went on a weeknight with my bf. waiter asked to take our coats, I paused to think if I wanted it taken and decided yes. Waiter remarks ""might as well get your money's worth, right?"". I was a little offended at the comment, I'm not going to lie to you. I am 28 year old professional but am constantly mistaken for a teenager- I think he judged us based on my ""age"" and our voucher. 

After that initial snafu his service was fairly good while he was around. He seemed genuinely interested in our opinions on the menu and food. Had the beef tar tar, which could have been better. The taste of Dijon mustard was very strong and the meat was cut up almost to mush (rather than small chunks). Waiter changed shifts while we were eating but we were never told and were made to wait a long time. 

The restaurant crowd wasn't my style either. Seemed like accomplished mid life adults who care a lot about $ and image. I prefer a more down to earth crowd (despite $ or age) and atmosphere- this could have just been the night we went (Tuesday). Food was good  but seemed slightly off mark. I expected better based on the reputation and price. 

I honestly felt like we were given the ""pretty woman"" young+poor treatment. Guess you can't tell by looking at us that we have good dual incomes and no children to eat up our $. 

Bc we had the voucher I didn't mind as much that we weren't taken seriously and that the food was lacking- we were underpaying for it anyway!

All in all the food is a lot better than most restaurants. I think my dish was possibly good but not put together with has much care on a that particular night. My mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. Deserts were good too, nice and light. 

I wouldn't chance going back and getting similar service while paying full price. It wouldn't be worth it."
kLMNy32I-Y0B8f6NbaO5pQ,"Rarely do I ever venture east of Yonge. It terrifies me. But when my BFF requested we go to Table 17 for her birthday, I put on my big girl pants and made my way to the East. Walking along queen, east of Broadview, I was amazed at how much has changed (I lived on Broadview and Dundas years ago and this was NOT the place to be). 

Once we arrived at Table 17 I was really impressed with the overall vibe. Warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (I love seeing who's making my meal!). 

I had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. It was chalked full of flavour. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (Some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). 

The server was wonderful. He had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed. 

Great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks."
SbP4WoInuFF3KxY33mocOQ,"Had brunch again at Table 17 for a third time and each time it's been better and better.  Last time I had the daily quiche and it was good.  Today I have the Alsatian tart with salad and I enjoyed every bite of it.  

I'm really shocked to read all the reviews about bad service.  Having been to this restaurant six or so times now, I have never once encountered any rudeness.  Maybe I've just lucked out."
3ljuhghMnJDB_ZuGiVtRvQ,"I am reluctant to write a review for Table 17 only because I want it to be Leslieville's best kept secret! I went for brunch with my husband and a friend. For Saturday brunch at prime brunching hour, we were quickly seated. The place wasn't full like all the surrounding places so not only were we served quickly, but we were also not rushed out the door. It made a great easy Saturday morning. 

Serving staff were friendly and helpful. We loved that their bread comes from Bonjour Brioche, the best bakery east of the Don! My tart was so flaky and warm. Great sweet and savoury flavours in an appropriate portion for brunch. Everyone's plates were well-presented. 

The decor had rustic charm and we didn't feel crammed in like many small brunch spots. 

Our coffees and water were constantly refilled and I spent an easy afternoon sitting and catching up with friends. What more can you ask for to make an enjoyable and easy-going Saturday brunch? 

I would definitely return to Table 17."

My friend and I walked in around 11:00am on a Saturday after a workout. The restaurant was reasonably busy but there was no line-up - a welcome change for weekend brunch in Leslieville/Riverdale! The interior is dark wood/brick and quite cozy. Realistically, we were a little under-dressed for the occasion but they welcomed us in any event.

My friend had a dish (whose name escapes me) but consisted of eggs served on bolognese sauce on top of polenta. I had the quiche with a tomato salad. Both were really fantastic. Brunch entrees were reasonably priced at about $10.

During our meal we saw a server walk by wih an order of frites and quickly decided we had to order them. No regrets here - crispy, salty, and delicious! At $4, totally worth it.

I would absolutely return and recommend."
XLcIW09xJTIgUzjwUkT-5A,"Dropped in on a Sunday for Table 17's BYOW Table D'Hote.  There was a '96 Bourdeaux that just had to be drunk and so my friend and I spent a lovely Sunday evening dinner obliging.  
Table D'hote gives you a  selection of pork belly, steak frites, trout and a vegetarian option with a selection of first courses and desserts to go with it.  
Neither of our dishes disappointed.  
What we got was high quality, well prepared bistro fare at a very reasonable price.  Service was efficient if not overly friendly. 

I remain a fan of this cosy Queen East bistro and wouldn't think twice about many repeat visits."
zQiUh7rGAGFoVE6n2mpvfw,"The fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for $35 were to die for. Uncorking two bottles of Chateauneuf du Pape for free was simply priceless.  I am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in Toronto."
Ing_TePSktj9qCvI-z07Hg,"Nice atmosphere with good food and attentive service.

The much-touted hot balls appetizers are a little over-rated: they are basically breaded, deep-fried balls of something with dipping sauce and were edible but nothing to write home about.

For entrees we had the delicious beef short ribs and black cod.  Both were cooked to perfection and in manageable portions (I often feel that mediocre fine-dining restaurants throw large portions at you to compensate for weak flavour).

$250 for 4 people with some booze."
pPPk-A3Hx6YApitBccDWsA,"Lovely ambience, we had a nice table for 2 by the window. I'm sure the table beside us could hear our conversation as we could hear theirs when there was a pause in ours. 

The service started off being attentive and slowly started to slip (e.g. My date had to go find a waiter to get me a side plate for me to put shells from my seafood linguine, despite me having asked for it 5 min earlier). The fresh oysters were amazingly delicious and fresh! 

I enjoy dipping my bread in olive oil and Table 17's olive oil was no better or worse then any other nice restaurant's. My seafood linguine was average. I believe my date had lamb and he said it was fine. We also ordered a bottle of wine and felt their wine selection was appropriate. Overall, we weren't blow out of the water and have made no plans to go back as we were expecting more. Make sure you make a reservation!"
J5x0w4x7D1mkUAtUbK9dMw,"The summary of 3 stars for Table 17 is that it's too expensive for it's location and quality.  It's still pretty good, I just don't like seeing a cheque for $60 for brunch.  

The good:
- The food is good and the ingredients are top quality
- Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees
- Brunch has a 14oz Blanche de Chamblis with a splash of OJ for $4 which is the best value on this menu
- They do potato rosti right
- Sarah T orders TWO sides of bangers because she loves them so much... I really do like their bacon
- Good service both times I've been
- Proximity to my house
- they use opentable

The bad:
- It is too expensive.  The breakfasts don't come with sides, and sides each cost $4. So scrambled eggs with toast is $10, plus bacon is $14 plus hashbrowns is $18. I could maybe stomach $14.95 for a complete brunch, but I hate paying 10$ for eggs then having to add on the things I feel should come with it.  Maybe I'm not classy enough to eat bacon here.
- It's not as good as Le Select brunch, which I don't mind splurging $60 on once in awhile. I won't spend my $60 here instead of there. (both times I've been here Sarah T picked.)

No funny stories.

Would I go here again?  Maybe.  I might try it out for dinner one one of the BYOB nights.  Man, this place is just too expensive.  I know that's all I keep saying about it, but they charge too much for the food here."
1K1YYeyrQfpaYc021nWKYg,"This was a nice little surprise.  My Friend and I were planning on going to The Comrade which is 4 units West of Table 17 but their food selection was limited.  The Comrade bartender recommend this place so we thought we'd give it a whirl.  

There was a good feel to this two roomed restaurant, classy but not fancy.  There was a long wooden table in the middle of the 2nd room where the wait staff cut bread and got their serving supplies from which I thought was a nice touch.  The waitress we had was extremely helpful in her recommendations, both in food and drink and cute as could be.

I will return."
DexBF1k8zV3lW9sNzpB0jg,"I can't seem to make the half star symbol work because I'd give Table 17 three and a half stars. I found myself there late last night where I met up with an old friend for dinner. I have been wanting to go there for a while so when I found myself on the eastern side of the city dealing with a late day work issue I seized the opportunity. 

I can't say all that much about the decor as we sat on the side western side of the restaurant right by the door (in all fairness, we just walked in and had no res so we knew it would be hit or miss). The other side of the restaurant, from what I could see, looked lovely and it appears that they have one of those large chef's tables as well. 

Specials of the day included an unusual app of deep fried Zucchini flowers stuffed with ricotta (3 on a plate). The waiter explained that these flowers were only available for about two weeks of the year and it was a very special menu addition. The main menu is not that large with approx. half the mains being some sort of fish (arctic chair, salmon, halibut, scallops). 

We started with the charcuterie board because I wanted to compare it with the charcuterie board that my fellow yelper, Deanna and I shared at Swirl the day before. The bread they served was very unusual, some sort of blueberry bread with walnuts in it. Very fresh but very heavy. The board consisted of four different types of meats, a small terrine of chicken pate, a couple of dried figs with walnuts shoved in them, no cheese of any sort, nor any savory (I have this thing for olives!).  Pate was pretty good but not anywhere near as good as the pate we chowed down on at Swirl. Would have loved the figs if maybe they had squeezed some mascarpone into them and then shoved the nuts in. I'm such a foodie critic. To drink we ordered the McManis Cabernet Sauvignon ($55) and it is a very reliable bottle of red. 

I opted for (let's be predictable Christine) the steak frites and my friend had the poached halibut. The steak was delicious and cooked to order (medium rare). The frites are so crispy, crunchy and tangled, just the way I love them but what the hell is up with all the salt? I mentioned this to the waiter when he asked me how my meal was and then to his credit he brought out an little bowl of frites sans salt. He insisted. He also apologized for the kitchen as he said sometimes they don't realize how much kosher salt they are tossing into the bowl when they shake up the frites. The halibut was meaty but bland as hell. Then again, it is poached. Great if you are on a diet. Personally I felt it could have been poached in perhaps a court bouillon with lots of fresh herbs. My friend began picking at my plate which tells me that she wasn't sated by her dinner because she dived right into the bowl of extra frites. 

We passed on dessert. After all that meat there was no way I could eat dessert (urp!). All in all, I liked Table 17. The service was great, our waiter as friendly and stayed on top of making sure our glasses were looked after. Still, something just felt slightly off for me and I can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps it may have just been our location inside of the restaurant, I never really felt like I was in it.  I would be willing though, in all fairness, to give Table 17 another go.   The lamb sounded wonderful as did a couple of the specials of the day.  I so gotta learn to step outside my steak obsession!"
74P8qKUUGy9yQ5j_smzkrQ,"Table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. My girlfriend and I stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. We then returned for Sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.

The people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. The servers are very friendly and helpful. The decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. 

Speaking of food, it's the best part. I don't have a high end palate, but I can say that I enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. Servings were generous so you won't come away hungry. 

Bravo guys. Bra-vo."
4rnjBGZ8nJQlYgyBQxLIuA,"We're regulars here. Delicious brunchs! Delicious dinners! Service is quick and helpful. Is a dressed-up/relaxed place. Bonjour Brioche have a line, come here!!!"
eOa6zF8E1CC3ZW5poylHgA,"I had very high expectations of Table 17 as it was recommended to us by a bartender at Origin (where I had a phenomenal experience - see my review) and a good family friend (who has exquisite taste). What do they say about having high expectations? You will usually be disappointed. Sigh. 

And so it goes...

 I loved the space at Table 17. It felt classy rustic, if that makes sense. The intimate bistro (composed of two small rooms) had wood floors and walls, antique lights and a subdued color palette. I felt relaxed. 

The service was superb. Our waitress was more than a joy and spouted all the day's specials by memory and was well-versed in the few wines we were deciding between. She was attentive, humorous and gave great recommendations. 

The food? It was good, but forgetable (don't hate me, Table 17!). I wanted them to elevate the flavors. Punch me in the face and make me giddy. Make me moan with pleasure (food here people, get your mind out of the gutter!). Make me want to lick the plate clean. 

Like the last green leaf on a tree whose leaves are changing with the Autumn air, the dolce forte wild boar polenta was the sparkling highlight in the crowd. They change the polenta frequently, but it's a must order. Even if you don't like polenta, order it. The presentation itself is worth it. You are brought a thick slice of wood where the polenta is perched. Two table spoons of fresh herbs and red pepper flakes accompany it. Chef John Sinopoli comes out himself and scoops the pipping hot wild boar out of the pot and onto the polenta as he explains the ingredients and care that went into it. It was delicious. Not too gamy, not too heavy, just right. I would have liked it a bit saltier, but maybe that's just me. I have an addiction to salt (blush). 

We also ordered the chilled white gazpacho (definitely recommend), charcuterie board (typical), warm roasted beets side dish (yummy but I wanted more goat cheese!), summer arugula salad with blue cheese and peaches (the peaches were lovely) and the steak tartare. I am a sucker for steak tartare and always order it when it's on the menu. Table 17 serves it differently, they mix beets into the chopped beef. While some may like this, I did not. It tasted like beets, not meat. I missed the salt (shocked?), the capers, the onions, the quail egg on top, the savory flavors of a traditional steak tartare. 

I know every restaurant can't be phenomenal, but at those prices, I am a bit tougher on the food and my expectations are a bit higher. I liked Table 17. I would give it another shot."
IJu2nUgiiEyvKjd4mA59gw,"Appetizer:
Hot Balls: Arancino - Mushroom & Fontina stuffed risotto, Goat cheese - with wildflower honey, Arancino - Spiced lamb stuffed risotto with mint
My friend asked me which one is which as she could not decipher. The flavours of each is not very strong....like it didn't punch you in the face. The mushroom flavour was not very full. The lamb flavour was very slight. The one with the most flavour is the goat cheese ball. It really had to be elevated by the sauce at the side. I actually had no issue with that because I often find the gamey taste of lamb and goat distasteful. She on the other hand was slightly disappointed about the legendary hot balls from Table 17. 

Diver Scallops: Diver Scallops with Roasted with fresh bay leaves, served with sauce béarnaise & guanciale
I liked this dish. It was again on the heavier and saltier side. Everything plated works together harmoniously. The scallop balanced the béarnaise and the guanciale perfectly. The texture of the scallop is escalated by the crunchiness of the guanciale. 

Entrée:

Haddock: Haddock with chanterelle mushroom, sprouts, truffled potato, radish
Perhaps our expectations for fresh seafood is a little high. We both felt the haddock is lacking in freshness. Fresh fish tends to hold together better. The sprouts were supposed to reduce the heaviness of the dish but it just wasn't enough. 

Dessert:

Lemon Panna Cotta with Blueberry compote. This dessert hit all the right notes! The panna cotta was silky and smooth (like my legs...just kidding!) The delicious blueberry compote adds fruitiness (DUH!) to the plate! The lemon balm gives it a bite of citrus taste. It was awesome! The combination just sings in your mouth! I can eat that all day! Nom nom nom! 

In the end, I wish the chef would balance the dishes with more acids, spices and fresh herbs instead of sodium and grease. We are definitely anomalies here. Table 17 had garnered a lot of loyal patrons over the years. I really wanted to fall in love with this cosy little restaurant!"
fbUfvWQw9ScdGinxahPutg,"I am a fairly regular dinner guest at Table 17, and thought it was time to leave a review.

Among the cosy bistros popping up in Leslieville, Table 17 was among the first, and is among the best for its consistency in quality of food and service. I also really appreciate the Sunday & Monday BYOB nights, and wish other restaurants would take Table 17's lead on this generous offering.

I am always happy to see my favourite mains such as the braised beef short ribs and steak frites on the menu (and I happily order them over and over each visit - the fries appear to be crisply double fried in duck fat in traditional Belgian style. Yumm!) 

That said, the menu does not seem to have changed very much over the years, and I almost wish they would take that risk and do a bit of a menu refresh. I still give it 4 stars because I go there when I crave my favourites. When I'm feeling adventurous, I just go a little further west on Queen to Ruby Watchco."
PFqnL8q2ipKj-eZWAZy2Zw,Taste good but bad value. Portions are way too small. We both had a app main and desert and still very hungry.
FhpVX2jrqiF1oDghyyA-5w,"Very good food and great atmosphere, friendly service. Bottom line: impossible to go wrong with a visit."
Jl_JjxrOReAXpWppP9m9Kw,"Went to a Brunch party and it was so cool and awesome, the food and service where amazing and the stuff where so funny!! 

Know I here is shut down and closed that's sad :("
kgVI4dW1kWlBJqFI6187YA,"What a relaxed place to enjoy a nice dinner. Table 17 is intimate, split into two rooms.  The service is very personal but not invasive.  Tonight we got the right amount of attention without feeling rushed. 

The menu is well edited with interesting selections. We choose the artichokes and  bocconcini as the starters followed by venison and steak tartare, with sides of amazing Brussels sprouts and frites. All excellent, but the venison was truly a standout. 

I have been here a couple of times, but tonight was the best. Certainly will return."
wcgtJ2FMQjcOJsa_glqP2Q,"I think the main problem with this place is that it is too small to accommodate people who may want to hang out after dinner and have a few drinks. There is a bar, but it's small. 

As for the food: quality ingredients, food cooked simply, and the right way. The trout was prepared perfectly. Overdone fish can be a problem, but not here. 

The food was also not over-seasoned, which is one of my peeves with restaurant food in general. The flavors of the foods themselves are predominant here. Not that I don't enjoy spice, but there is a balance.

The duck rillette was really delightful, and I am generally not a huge duck fan. I'm not sure if that was orange zest or I imagined it in there, that's how subtle the flavors can be, but  I loved it. Especially the piquance of the pickled carrots with the toast and meat. Would have bought a quart of the pickles if we had room in our luggage. 

The duck-fatted mash was bit too heavy for me that night, but my fiance had no trouble finishing it off. They give you a good heaping pile.  The greens were perfect to me--again, very simply prepared. 

The arugala salad had the perfect amount of dressing on it. A little too much goat cheese on it for me though, could have been balanced more in that way for me. 

We might even go back before we leave Toronto  to try the Polenta, which unfortuntely they were out of."
15jv3wYvtnS3bv6dDAKyIw,Disappointing experience.  The restaurant was packed and my friend and I were crammed into a small table where we were basically touching elbows with the tables beside us.  The food wasn't anything special which surprised me - I had been intrigued to try this place for a while but I won't be going back.
Jd-Twvmb3acE3fT8UH7JFA,"Went for Sunday brunch. Nacoise salad for me, scramble of the day for my friend.  Waiter had an attitude. Food was good / acceptable. Decor was lovely (especially the bathroom!), however  I wouldn't go back again."
p9cWIp_b_73CtKam8u3EIQ,"Table 17 is a quaint find in Leslieville village perfect for a good catch up with your girlfriends or a dinner date.  The restaurant is divided into two rooms - the first room you walk into features a long bar and some seating and the room towards the side which we get seated in, is simple, farmhouse chic.  The menu has amazing sharing plates and we do choose a couple to start with. 
We were very impressed with the presentation of the polenta du jour dish.  This is a must at Table 17!  The fluffy, white polenta, dished out on a wooden cutting board was accompanied by the chef who ladled a ""ragu"" of steaming lamb on top of it. There was chili and dried basil on little spoons for more flavour.  It was heart-warming, a generous portion - ideal for our group of 3.  The lamb ragu was flavourful and the polenta with some grated Parmesan cheese and cracked pepper was still light as air.
As a note, Sundays and Mondays it's bring your own wine with no corkage fees with decent prix fix menu on offer"
Actc5kcYxlR8uYCYrh68yQ,"Meh. Service was bad and food wasn't much better. The restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.

To be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. The main course was a huge disappointment. My fiancé ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. It was bland and undercooked. The avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. I ordered the Simcoe County Pork Chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. Super bland, no spices. 

Maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed."
ZFj_gIgu0V2qIez1aET5Tw,"I had a groupon certificate for Table 17 and I'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place I really want to try or already like, We walked in without reservations, which I am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet.

I've heard others complain about the service here. I found it to be fabulous, and I'm in the industry myself, so I know what the job entails. Our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.

The hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. Lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.

Desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but I loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. Delicious.

Overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!

P.S. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. Your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this."
wq8HbFMyDGAMMdSChyS7tA,"Had dinner with some colleagues on Monday Dec 30, 13.  The food was ah-ma-zing!!  In addition it was BYOW night and no corkage fee - just some extra special icing on an already delicious cake!  You can't go wrong at table17."
EKIrMW8Do8rR3OtdQY6f1Q,"I'm confused as to how to rate Table 17. When I lived in Toronto I ate here quite a bit for brunch and so when visiting the area again I was excited to go back. 

The food and service were good, but my confusion lies in the cost of the Caesar at brunch time. It used to be $4.50 or $5. I saw they have a super special one on menu for $12 but I cannot justify paying that much for a Caesar. So I ordered a regular one, followed by another regular one. I was shocked when the bill came and they were $9/each. Ouch!

My bad for not reading the menu fully and noticing they are not part of the discounted brunch drinks anymore."
hypJVgWGTNxWCeNBjFwfUg,Came for brunch with my wife and two young boys on a Saturday. We had the scotch eggs and Giuseppe eggs. They have $4 kids meals too. We got the French toast which was two slices with fruits. We also got a side of rosti. Everything was really delicious and unique. I've been searching for a great French toast and this one was right up at the top. Full of flavour but not too heavy. Prices were all pretty reasonable around $10-$12. We'll be coming back for sure!
3FGjx0dgPKY1tCBYLxaoEA,"What a great little restaurant in Leslieville.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service.  Not too expensive and the the variety on the menu was a nice change from many other restaurants in the city. 

Call me a fan. I will definitely go back!"
2v685kARRKjNxjxAaHYbfA,"For a small place, Table 17 is very accommodating.  I was a part of a very large party (10+ people) who could not make up their mind.  Various members called the restaurant multiple times to change our reservation.  I was horrified that when we showed up, they were going to turn us away (I would!).  But, they did not.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, and we were all served very quickly.  The waiter made excellent suggestions for drinks, apps, and entrees.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The ambience is nice, quiet yet trendy.  The bathrooms were immaculate and while we were in the front room near the bar, the back room had a center table as a servers station for bread and wine bottles.  The only downside is that the entrees were very small - fortunately they weren't horribly expensive.   The drinks on the other hand.... Let's just say I'm very happy I wasn't paying ($15 for a basic martini)."
vcaoApX4YBRLYuKV28Eezw,"I have only been for brunch but was impressed.  Very friendly staff.  Somewhat traditional French brunch menu, and well executed items.  They have some fun cocktails, and the ambiance is great.  The nature of the menu (not traditional brunch obviously) precipitates only infrequent visits (I'm and eggs benny guy on Sunday mornings) but when we go we love it."
k5R2b5ZdTsxH5dFl5JdUpA,"All hail the mighty Groupon, without which I never would have experienced this place. After a really long, rainy, and cold school week during which my meals mainly consisted of stuff I grabbed from convenience stores on campus, I really needed a good dinner. Table 17 hit just the right spot. We started with a charcuterie plate, which was all kinds of good and porky. The standout starter for me, though, was the Ribollita soup -- a white bean soup with pancetta and kale. I could live off bowls of that stuff. For my main, I chose the braised short ribs. They were fork tender, but slightly dry and tough on top -- maybe I got the top of the pot or something -- but still delicious and just the perfect comfort food that I needed.

Service was great for the most part, but they were experiencing problems with their credit card machine that was a little frustrating -- they didn't seem to have a separate phone line for their credit card machine, so every time someone would call the restaurant, it would kick the credit card machine offline. Consequently, it took FOREVER to get our card charged for dinner. The food was excellent and I'm definitely coming back soon (dying to try their BYOW Table D'hote on Sundays and Mondays), but next time I visit, I'm totally bringing cash."
FHWSAPYcX0qY9DAKcdcw3g,"We've been here for brunch a couple of times. Had the rosti both times, as well as the neapolitan eggs and the weekly scramble. Both times everything has been excellent and the service is great and friendly. Also entirely reasonably priced. Recommended."
L3DqaARjr6I7RziyxMFERA,"I've been to Table 17 twice, and since the first time I came here, I have been anticipating the next time I would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding!
With a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, I knew I had to get in here for what I hoped to be a fantastic dinner.

The tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions I had (I always have questions!)

For our shared appie, we went with the Burrata because I have been looking for a good burrata dish since I moved back to TO and had not found it yet.- I tried one at Reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. I thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. The flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.

It happened to be Good Friday and I really did not plan to eat meat that night. I was tempted to go with the shortribs because I knew I would not be disappointed from my first experience. I was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.

On a whim, I went with the scallops at the very last second. It came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since I had some good scallops and I definitely had set some high expectations. On first bite..... I was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and I could not get enough. I'm just not a super big fan of clams, so I cannot really comment on them. None the less, I tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! The short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.

For dessert .... I did not have to look at the menu - sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. Rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like I remembered and more! S had the banana cheesecake, which I was hesitant about because I'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. With a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.

I'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. As someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, I can vouch that this one will not disappoint."
VjDmZq8wyyAjBarXceWstQ,"I can never resist hot ballZ (sexy menu item here at Table 17).

Conveniently located near Jilly's (hey!!!), Table 17 is possibly a little too beautiful for the neighbourhood, but I suppose that makes it a true diamond in rough because it's such a nice place.

I tried the Ontario lamb with merguez sausage (lamb x 2!) for my entree. Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the merguez was delicious. A perfect plate.

The hot balls come 3 ways and each is served with it's own dipping sauce. I think these are a ""must have"" if you come here.

The service was excellent and our water & wine was always kept topped off .

It's a small place with only a few tables, dark hardwood, large mirrors, chandeliers and a nice long wooden table in the middle with food artfully displayed. Definitely a great date spot.

The wine list is extensive but the price point was a bit over the top - no bottles under $60 and the 1/2 liters started at $45. Apparently on Sunday/Monday you can bring-your-own-wine, but not sure what the corkage fee was."
GAcivlxYCCapdmMzBgjFIQ,I have been hear a couple of times and overall have enjoyed the food.  I had the trout as my main and it was very fresh and perfectly cooked.  It came with some pretty boring side vegetables but overall the meal was satisfying.  Its a little on the pricey side but our server was great and I enjoy the vibe.
VKcXJGdqyB0EO5LLfGeHfw,"Table 17 is okay. The hot balls are pretty standout although for $12 for 6 ($2 a ball) I'm not sure I would order them again (thank you miracle of groupon-type discount!). The goat cheese balls were excellent, reminding me I never get enough goat cheese in my diet or to my liking. I would not recommend dipping them in the accompanying honey. The sweet just masks the wild goat cheese taste. Actually, it would be nice if you could order 6 goat cheese hot balls straight up.

My pickerel was a big bowl of meh. It tasted like something you might get during a summer/winterlicious. Being from the Lake Erie region, I like a tenderly cooked pickerel that allows you to enjoy the delicate texture and nuanced flavor of this white fish. But Table 17 prepares it extra crispy, burning the joy out of this fish. 

Slinky woman ordered the arctic char and seemed to have no complaints.

Portions are a touch small given the prices. You get a couple slices of decent bread before your meal.

Service is excellent.

Table 17 seems a nice addition to the aspirational bars that have cropped up in Leslieville along Queen street. The only thing I hate about Leslieville is it seems so dark. The strip needs some BIA work."
IN36oY4LbL3Ts_yXXBRTmw,"Quite a great meal. Came early and even though we booked using OpenTable and it was busy, we were allowed to sit. 

Special was Foie gras and said yes before the words were out of the servers mouth. Shared tartare and it was glorious with a very large hint of moutarde, but U dug it. Shoulder of Ontario lamb was great with a hint of mint in the salsa verde. I'm not a dessert guy but the Gateau Elvis with chocolate, caramelized bananas and peanut butter was awshum. 

Nice wine list. Will return soon. 

Only thing hindering a 5-star is the fact that we had to top up our own wine a couple times."
SMO2bJwqn3ZVfkAeRADmqg,"The things that I liked:

Interior was homely, lots of wood used on the walls & furniture, there was a chandelier & the bar had accommodation to dine at if you chose to.

Server was a very lively & attentive British man.

Some qualms I had with the place was that my drink was a bit warm & my food not warm enough.

The steak frites was excellent & cooked medium-rare. Steak tartare could have been a bit colder as the dish is meant to be served cold.  Shared PEI Oysters were very fresh & succulent.

 For the prices paid, I expected a little more out of Table 17. There are better options out there for the price range."
Ek69QrhQtlFH92BlbIzBhQ,"My experience with Table 17 were excellent.

I do like the French Countryside deco giving the interior a homey and farmhouse vibe.

We were greeted warmly at the door and the service was really attentive for the whole evening.

We shared:

Lamb Polenta ($14)
Duck Confit ($26)
Vanilla poached rhubarb ($8)

Everything was well prepared with great care. I even enjoyed my Lamb Polenta and I am not a lamb or polenta lover!

The restaurant did get busy even on a weekday evening. I guess a lot of people were taking advantage of their prix menu $35 during Sunday and Monday with BYOW.

Will definitely return when I am in the neighbourhood.

PS: Thanks Amy L for the invitation"
yJoJhj-UyS2JnvjBJg_Qmg,"wow this place is amazing for brunch, french style cuisine, free parking on side streets even on weekends! bonus! i didn't know there were coupons and deals at this place as I was reading the reviews but I would still pay full price to come here, gotta try dinner someday. good vibe here, good neighbourhood, good food! no line-ups for brunch either"
5gx2BOdilpycJSbcWZEKqA,"I wanted to go to Table 17 since I moved down to Leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. My party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Unfortunately that's how the night continued. The decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. We ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about $28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. We waited about 15 minutes for our drink. When we finally received our food at about 9:45 it was nothing special. To top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree I didn't even order. There are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince."
NyYZ78XcczwgmXPqUc8cwg,"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! I had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. What I loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil I have tried I can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil. 

Glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!"
bLHMKw5LEXUCodI5-F8yww,"I had the most wonderful experience at Table 17 recently. I took advantage of the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion in which you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of an entrée. To top it off, parking was free at this part of town after 6 pm on weekdays. 

My boyfriend had the potato and bacon soup. I had two delicious spoonfuls of the soup. I enjoyed chewing on the bits of bacon, which added a delectable smokiness to the creamy soup. 

I ordered the appetizer special of the day - chicken liver parfait. I absolutely loved this! The liver spread was delightfully creamy and I loved that intense flavour of the liver, complemented by a dab of tangy Dijon mustard.

Steak Frites - 8oz thick cut top sirloin, served with lemon mayo - was executed to perfection. The steak was juicy, flavourful and amazingly tender. I really enjoyed the meat, but what stood out the most for me was the lemon mayo, which was, in one word, addictive. I wanted to eat it all right off a spoon. 

I had the striped bass, served over sweet onion purée and tartar garnish, with beer battered sweet dumpling squash and hen of the woods mushroom. I enjoyed all the components on the plate, and everything worked well together. The fish was perfectly cooked and the skin was nice and crispy. I wiped my whole plate clean and wanted more. 

For dessert, our first choice was the maple panna cotta, topped with candied bacon strips. The bacon's saltiness really brought out the sweetness of the panna cotta and also provided a great crunch. The panna cotta, which came out resembling a block of tofu, was creamy and satisfying.

Our other dessert choice was the honey and pistachio tart with crème anglaise. I loved that there was a generous amount of nuts in every bite. I wished the pistachio could be a little more toasted and crunchier, but the tart was, nevertheless, delicious. 

It was a delicious meal and a great experience altogether. I can't wait to go back."
X1Vimh5En427lvZQ4v2vKw,"After trying to find a table at various downtown restaurants downtown and frowned upon for expecting to ""walk-in"" on a Saturday night we happened to find parking (another surprise for a Saturday night) right in front of Table 17 as if it was meant to be. We walked in expecting to be turned away, especially since it was quarter past 10pm,  and were graciously seated at a pretty table by the window. The atmosphere was perfect - mellow but happy crowd lingering over dessert, attentive hostesses dressed casual and candlelight in a rustic contemporary decor.

The menu isn't extensive but offers a good variety to please any dietary preferences. We ordered the soft shell crab to start and it was set on top of a green chutney which elevated the taste of the crab and was just delicious. I had the lemon caper pasta which was really good and my DH ordered the lamb which was falling-off-the-bone goodness on a plate. We finished with the toffee cake dessert and it is high on my list of favorite desserts. It was decadent, luscious and big enough to share (but who wants to!).

A great evening and I am glad we didn't get a table anywhere else - Table 17 rocks!"
HAz9jl1PJnnnN_n_Y2XQeQ,"My partner and I went to Table 17 for dinner while on a visit to Toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.

Our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of Toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about Table 17. The atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. It's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.

The menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. My pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  My partner had the steak frites for entrée, and I while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non-steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well-executed.

The service was definitely a bright spot here. Our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. There's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. If you care, that one is ...Table 23. ;)"
dEmvzghnkGHFLo_jR9rfHQ,"I've been a resident here for almost 3 years, and I've been pleased with my time here.  First off, location is great for Scottsdale within walking distance to Sandbar, California Pizza Kitchen, At One Yoga, and a gas station, and plenty of other options within driving distance.  Approximately 10 minutes to both Kierland Commons, North, and Scottsdale Fashion Square, South.  

My specific apartment is on the 2nd (top) floor, and the high ceiling and sky light make the living room fill with natural light.   We pay an average price for the area, 1100/month, and that's after 2 years of raising it.  I have always, always, always felt safe there, which is important for a single woman in her 20's.  There are 3 pools on site too.  

As far as office/management, Karen is firm and can come across as harsh, but she is just doing her job.  Maintenance is AMAZING - after several days of my key sticking in the lock I called maintenance and in less than 30 minutes I had someone come up, look at the problem, get a new lock part, and fix it!  Good service, helpful attitude.  

Only negatives would be parking on the weekend and that they don't accept UPS packages anymore, so you have to go to the Post Office to get them.  Annoying.  It's also noisy on the occassional Friday or Saturday night - but never bad enough that I couldn't sleep."
0qb8egB4FLhqfi7SsiUUTw,"They are changing their complex name to Mosaic, so be forewarned the issues will exist there, too.

I am sick of this. The water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. The first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now I wake up and there is no water and I can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work!

Also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. They also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and I come home from work after it is dark. Since I come home after dark, I notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently.

The new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. You can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late."
VPEFgiiiWqMYoUjNN0azxg,"I was going to post this for the leasing office, but it seems more appropriate to put it under the community as a whole...

After searching for a new place for a couple of months, I settled on Acacia Creek.  I had liked what I'd seen on the walk-throughs, and everyone in the office was pleasant enough.  One thing I'd noticed, however, is that the prices for their available units change every day.  So I waited until the price was where I wanted it to be, and headed over with the full intent to sign a one-year lease.

Right before I entered the leasing office, I pulled up their website on my phone and confirmed the amount.  I walked in and was seated with an agent/manager with whom I had toured the property less than a week ago.  We made small talk, and she pulled up the unit in question...and quoted me a price ten dollars higher than what I saw online.  It wasn't that big of a deal, but I was quite confused.

I pulled up the price on my phone again and noted that at that very instant, there was a discrepancy between what she said and what I saw online.  Her defense was that ""[their] prices change every day,"" but when I asked about the accuracy of the online pricing, she just repeated the line.

I tried to find out why she would give me a different price quote, and she just repeated the line again.  I had my phone, and the unit price, staring me in the face, and she was telling me that it was wrong!  She then said that I should have booked during the previous week and said goodbye, as she apparently wasn't willing to negotiate down to their listed price or explain what was going on.

I have no idea why she couldn't say something like, ""Our website isn't accurate - you should call,"" or, ""Let me see what I can do"" or anything like that. She was willing to lose someone who was ready to sign ON THE SPOT because she couldn't be bothered to explain a slight difference in rent rates.

If this is how they treat prospective tenants who WANT to live there and pay their rent, I can't imagine how they treat their residents."
_7I-gyu2TEVtkBSIv56srA,"I don't expect much out of an apartment complex... lets be honest... we all had negative experiences that just make us hope for the essentials and that the staff will somewhat acknowledge your existence past routine notes taped to your door. That was my mentality before I moved into Acacia and I am SO GLAD that I live here!! It is amazing! 

Between four years of college and four years of post college, I have lived in approximately 8 apt complexes in 3 states and Acacia Creek is the BEST overall!!! First and foremost, the staff and maintenance are just absolutely outstanding. If you have a request, they will tend to it immediately. They remember your name and call just to touch base and make sure things are okay. They are very respectful of your privacy and the grounds always stay clean and maintained. The complex is fairly quiet... and I don't even see my neighbors very often but it seems like more professional couples, young adults and singles... though there are some families with young children as well. There are 3 pools, and 1 is heated, a decent sized gym and lots of uncovered parking. (and a recycling bin!!!) 

The location is great! It's just South of Scottsdale and Shea, on Gold Dust Avenue. Lots of things within walking distance grocery stores (Fresh and Easy, Safeway), bars and restaurants (Baja Bar, Eddies, Chop and Wok, Indulge Burger, Dennys, Oregenos), and two pharmacies. It's about 10 minutes to Old Town and Kierland Commons, approx 5-7 minutes to the 51 and 5-7 minutes to the 101. 

The apts are nice. We live in a 2 bdrm/ 2 bath corner unit on the 2nd floor (top floor) with a fireplace and a HUGE patio (approx 7x15!). It has a nice skylight and an entire wall of windows. One design flaw I noticed is that there's only one AC vent in the living room area, while there are 3 in the master bedroom which is half the size. It does take a long time for the living room to cool down on the hot days (esp being a top floor, corner unit with lots of exposure to the afternoon sun). But the walls are 2 toned with a nice beige accent wall in every room, including the bathrooms. The master has a large walk in closet and lots of storage. There is also a full sized washer and dryer. The appliances are older Hotpoints, but they work well so no real complaints outside of aesthetic purposes. 

Overall, if you are looking for an affordable option in the heart of Scottsdale, or you are new to the area and want somewhere safe and comfortable... DEFINITELY consider Acacia Creek.. you will not be disappointed!!"
_CVRMJj2sCragsx6gUik7g,"A beautiful set of high end shops. I can't really afford to shop here on a regular basis when i'm in Vegas, but I am a sucker for two of them.  The Rare Bookstore and Andrew's Ties usually get a visit out of me.

The fountain is usually the center of attention for tourists taking pictures of their sweeties or families.  If you sit near the water, don't move back too far or you'll get water down your pants!"
7NwjIHNt_Tey_hFeHIBRMg,"Definitely high end, high dollar stores! More like a museum than anything else. But it's so beautiful to walk around and do a little window shopping! Stop by Christian Louboutin and admire the red bottoms. Right across the way they have a little wine shop/lounge area to take a load off and enjoy a flight of white or reds or both! I very much enjoyed cruising around the shops."
GW0eEq3y8coWaWy-8609KA,"Love walking through here. Pretty views and displays.  And of course, high end stores.  Good restaurants can be found in here too."
yb-bohvPfYyQsDkiFOG_pw,"This was the highlight of my stay in Vegas! I love shopping at high end places, for some reason it makes me really happy spending loads of money. 
The mall itself is kind of small, but it is really pretty inside. 
Some shops here include Fendi, Barney's New York, Cartier, Ralph Lauren (includes Black Label) and Michael Kors.. Among others! 
All the stores are really nice with marble floors and such! 
This is the best place to go besides Rodeo Drive and 5th Avenue in New York if you're looking for an upscale shopping experience!"
dojbVgKjvMY5Gy65QGewdw,"Had a number of high end shops in a really nice setting but the place was relatively dead overall on a Saturday night. Most stores barely had 1 customer in them. The stores didn't do anything for me. 

Bottom line: Nice but I much prefer walking around the shops of Caesar's and Venetian."
o31WMkZsnWXpQPc3rwjmCQ,"This is one of those great Las Vegas places for window shopping and people watching. I haven't bought anything here, but I've spent several hours exploring the shops.  Bauman Rare Books is one of those fantastic stores where you want to walk around with your hands tied behind your back because you don't want to touch anything and leave a print on anything.  What an interesting shop.

I also window shop and the tie shop and I smile when I think that I know longer have to wear a tie unless i want to.  

Those are just two of the neat places in the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  I sometimes wonder how some stay in business because they're almost hiding in plain sight, but many people don't know the extent of the shoppes nor the different hallways that take you to different shops on different floors."
m76y2AAkyZT4SoIXiLt-qw,"Lots of great high end stores and a couple staples like Banana Republic and Victoria's Secret.  Lots of options for dining and a fun view of the ""Venice"" canals.  The reason why my rating is so low is based upon the number of irritating merchants trying to hawk their wares/goods.  Don't accept any samples from the brick/mortar stores either because as you can imagine they are pretty viscous.  The Tea store (?) store the salesman was so rude when I said I was not interested in trying their products.  I must have been approached by five or six different annoying salespeople as I'm trying to enjoy a leisurely stroll and shopping.  I must say my favorite place to shop is NorthPark Center in Dallas...no annoying kiosks or ""hawkers."""
s8DQGNovwcm2kurqsabnNw,"It wouldnt matter if I had all the riches in the world its just not my style all the uppity, high-end clothing & jewelry, to me its just not impressive. Yeah it sure is expensive but Not my cup of tea."
qChSJN6-EnjWgt17pWg_0w,"If you had all the money in the world, this is shopping heaven. I was drooling all over. Christian Loubitin boutique? Barney's New York? Chloé, Diane Von Furstenburg and Jimmy Choo all situated in one place! (They don't have a Chanel boutique but you will find one next door at the Wynn).  Basically, at The Palazzo, many of the stores have special collections you can't find anywhere else which is truly something ...

If you go in December, you will find some awesome deals. The shoes at Barneys were half off, and many of the stores had seasonal pieces at 40% off. If you are looking for high end fashion items, this is the place to go.

I'll def revisit when I come here, even for the sake of window shopping =)"
b-E_EMKIMwvbbHtQl9-vrg,"Definitely an upscale shopping center.
The shops/boutiques are definitely for the rich. =)

Great shopping experience."
W1kRqfgPv4yzbBJXZRjQAg,"Because it's on the Strip, we don't get down to The Shoppes to often....however, when we make the trip, we're always happy that we did.  There is a nice selection of upscale shops.....Fendi, Billionaire, Burberry, Coach...and many more.  Those are a few of the shoppes The Better Half (TBH) and I like to browse.

While we're here, we always make sure to stop by the Double Helix Wine Bar to enjoy a glass of Wine while we're shopping.

Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, it's away from the action of the Casino.  There's a good selection of restaurants on the 2nd floor as well.

Will I return?  You can count on it."
p413PZ20FDb2n-F0KWSSIQ,"A large collection of very upscale, world class stores. Although connected to the Venetian Canal, these two areas are worlds apart. The fountain area is very impressive, and very relaxing. I did notice that The Shoppes at Palazzo are very quiet and enjoyable, as there are virtually no children around. Very nice to grab a drink, walk through and enjoy the A/C, and do some fine window shopping.
There are a few restaurants scattered throughout, but the majority of the area is populated with upper class stores. My girlfriend and I spent about an hour or so, walking and window shopping. She refused to go into any stores due to the price factor, however couldn't resist walking into the Jimmy Choo shoe store.
Overall, an enjoyable experience. If you're like me and spent almost every bit of your savings to travel to Vegas, be prepared for a fun afternoon of looking at things you probably can't afford."
avqKYAcnGk7_M5Tfcxa_Xw,"I love the shops....perfect for window shopping, because most of the time I can't afford anything. Its usually never crowded, well whenever I've been there. 

Once you walk into one of the stores you get greeted by wonderful sales people. They make you feel so welcome. Walk into one of the stores, look around and sip on champagne. I utterly love that."
P2jAYuFRS1qk87Exw0ypSw,High end stores; very nice area to walk around if you want to window shop or get out of the Vegas heat.
v_ifw1_oBQoPdMnldcfyBA,"The Shoppes at the Palazzo is one of the finest collections of luxury brands you will find one the strip.  The mix what you need and what you want is dangerous because you can spend a lot of time and money over there and that's exactly what they are going for.  Nestled above the Palazzo Casino floor it feels much more welcoming than the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian although you can't discount the difference in atmosphere being a good change of pace.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is more of your ""traditional"" shopping setting.  This is a great place to go for shopping, dinning and just strolling around.  If you haven't stopped by I would make it a point to go."
8ETeD5EQ-c8dlmc3TSHXtw,"This mall is a lot smaller than the ones that I walked through in Vegas, especially since they don't have a huge number of stores for you to look at.

While the interiors and decorations of the mall looked really nice, the stores that they had were super pricey.

Well, if you want to take a nice little walk in a shopping area, then this place is okay to do so."
3n0PLe2xWz7GgCTH7q0gBA,"Of note, the Shoppes have been rolled into The Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian/Palazzo  under General Growth Properties. I imagine most of us will continue to consider these shoppes a separate entity for history's sake. This swanky mall within The Palazzo and now connected to the Grand Canal Shoppes houses restaurants and a wine bar as well as a variety of retail shops. Most of them are of a pricey, upscale nature, yes. Some aren't, such as Victoria's Secret, Tommy Bahama and Sephora. Double Helix is a cute little kiosk type wine bar located in the center of the shopping area. 

I've been to some of the restaurants a number of times, such as Grimaldi's and sushisamba, which is a standout. The shoppes have 3 levels, which proved to be wishful thinking even 9 years after the place opened! The atmosphere is kind of relaxing when it's not busy, and window shopping is usually cheaper than gambling!"
7kzi2KebVgEgROBQZXPkaw,"Really nice shopping mall.  Beautiful with some really nice high end stores.  Some of its shortcomings are it's small compared to other malls or even casino shopping malls, it doesn't blow you away like the Venetian Grand Canal Shops or Caesar's Forum Shoppes.  Although it's attached to the Grand Canal shops. Nonetheless, because I never miss the Grand Canal Shops, I make the short walk to this place.  When you win the Megabucks, you can afford to shop here."
DQLLzqFaFeOZetTok-KjVg,"I'm a little on the meh side for the Shoppes at the Palazzo because it's not a very inviting environment for shopping. It is true that some of the very high end, very up-scale stores reside here and without a lot of money its hard for you to enjoy this place. But wait!

The Forum Shops have JUST as many or similar types of designer stores ... why is it more fun?

Well in the end, I attribute it to the fact that the Forum Shops have some ""regular stores"" as to draw a crowd and shows which retain the crowd. You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care). I feel like a great shopping experience and the whole point of shopping in a store is for the interaction, direct or indirect, that you have with everyone else. When I walk into the Palazzo, it's so empty it makes me want to be somewhere else with more people despite the awesome designer stores.

This is not to say I will boycott the Shoppes, but it's definitely not my popular choice."
oG-lqaFIMfdEoqqwo4a3ww,"Some great shops, but CRAZY hard to get your bearings, find the store you're looking for, or keep track of which ""aisles"" you've ""done"" and what's left to shop... for a sport shopper like me, that's incredibly annoying - and tends to keep me away. Given almost all of these stores can be found in at least one other shopping center in Vegas..."
g8bZEXlmYxzilijMX33pfg,"Few unique, independent stores line the corridors of The Shoppes at The Palazzo, making this shopping center, well, just a shopping center, rather than a destination.  While it is well kept, it is perennial ghost town, which allows for more personal service in many of the shops."
sK9Ezn42uXIHxh20nXhmTA,"Three words for you...High End Expensive. 

I can't give the Shoppes at the Palazzo any less than 5 stars because they market, advertise, and sell MONEY.  That's their main goal.  Put a bunch of high end stores together and make money.  Since they accomplish their goal, you can't fault them for it.  When it comes to expensive goodies, might as well set it up correctly and at one of the more classier casinos like the Palazzo.  All the stores are maintained, clean, and have some of the best service ever, like ever.  

I've only been here a half dozen times and never bought anything due to my wine taste/beer budget.  But I can tell you one thing, you're never stereotyped here, you're never treated like you don't belong, and you're never more than a minute in a store without great service.  My issue...I just can't justify some of the expenses.  If I ever hit the CA Lottery (2, 23, 45, 55, 8, Mega 13) then you may finally find me here not window shopping, but actually getting something. 

The Shoppes at the Palazzo:  http://www.theshoppesatthepalazzo.com/directory"
ljCvyuh0ojd3B4XJE_YFag,"Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. 

My friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, ""That one is $1400."" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says ""Okay,"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!

Nothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? 

For the hard-working middle class schmo and ""normal"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip."
kMrg_M_HOuTTH52AE6v_lg,"Smashed burgers done properly in the heart of Weston village. Very happy that we have a spot like this now in the area. All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can't forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right.  Definitely worth trying this place ."

tegon_HXy6YneQJ4-Y5h4Q,"Great fresh burgers seared on a flat-top, and excellent fresh-cut fries and poutines, served up by an owner who cares.

Freshly-ground daily, a 4oz. scoop of AAA beef is dropped on the flat top then smashed flat and seared until it's nicely crusted, then served on a sesame seed bun. 

The beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour.

Their poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy.  

*Don't forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special.

In a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones. Definitely check it out and help keep this place alive, we need to keep joints like this around and successful."

My husband had the Z burger, I had the Heat burger and we shared the chef's poutine. Everything was amazing!!! Patty was very fresh and cooked to perfection and the toppings just topped it all off! The owner and his father were both so fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying everything! The place is very clean and lots of room for seating. The mama in me also noticed a high chair which is very convenient for families with babies/toddlers :) Definitely check this place out! Nice to see some good spots being put in Weston... will definitely be back soon!!!"

The smell of those burgers on the flat top would make a vegetarian reconsider their dietary choices. I'm ecstatic that they opened a legit burger joint in the Weston and Lawrence area. I love the area, grew up there, so any new business, especially one of Zeal Burger's quality, is a welcome addition to the 'hood. Thumbs way up guys keep it up! You deserve every star. Believe the hype."

He also makes sure the food is nice a presentable and treats every order and burger with perfection. I've tried The Heat and it's a pretty solid burger. It's a nice mix of ingredients. The fries were also pretty good. The area is spacious, clean and well maintained. 

I've never met someone who is so dedicated to perfection when it comes to serving food. I will most definitely be returning."
7iL5lmSEjKhxgmCuUrVpHw,The dude here is the nicest guy. Knew everything about the food and made us feel welcome. Burgers were amazing and worth the extra money. Skip Harvey's for this.
Uno26gf78bXx0oY4H3qALA,"Tastiest burger I've ever had! I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed:)"
svPvZfknc8mtDB4icvwBdA,"Honestly the best burger joint I've ever been too, hands down! I came here a couple months ago for the first time. I ordered the Sorry Eh burger and told them I prefer no egg and they were more then glad to leave it out. The feta poutine was amazing as was the Nutella milkshake! Very friendly owner and the other guy was as well! Keep up the good work and wish you all the best in the future!"
B8bSQAwvodDFEEs2kVRrCw,"This is by far one of the best burgers in the city.  I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now.  Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese.  OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection.  That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good.  Might even go back tomorrow for another!!!
Very clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover.  
PS
Ate it too fast to take any pics to post."
3X_vXAwhiROkspZFBZhR_g,"I read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Absolutely the best hamburger I've had in a long long time. Love the fries and the feta, the beef is grilled with a nice crust. Very friendly guy behind the counter, he walked us through the menu and made some recommendations. I am so happy that this place is so close to home."
zIitRcnEgDzMq7L6Kw6m9A,"Just had my first ever Zeal burger - I never did a review before but I felt like I had too here!  From the second I walked in with my guests, we were greeted with a great friendly smile!!!  The burgers were cooked in front of us and looked soooooo good!!!!  The fries are cooked to perfection and the burger is definitely memorable!!!!  100% recommendation!!!!!"
dE4kukIrmS1E8vlURN1l5A,This had to be one of the best burgers I've eaten in a long time! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to people.
S29p8jT6JMtvMTPbnjN-Bw,"First time here since the Sang's Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which ""chips"" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!"
SdjEuABgdjl6jxpiKkReAQ,"Burger patty is ground from AAA meat and made daily you can tell from the taste that it is fresh. Fries are not greasy. Burger was done right not overly seasoned or drowning in toppings. I can tell the cook/owner loves what he's doing as you can see and taste it in the food. Customer service was top notch, place is very clean. I live in Markham and will drive to this place again probably next weekend!!"
QedukfbFo4SMOahmWYpFxQ,"Wonderful service with a smile. The owner does everything himself (two thumbs up). One of the best best burgers in the city for sure. I wish they were open later though, just a thought."
hyDZcbKsYK4C_6N5h3qm1Q,"Excellent - so happy I discovered Zeal Burgers.  Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!).  Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy.   The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don't live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it."
x5sf5UtVAmz-j2fKXMbO5g,"Fantastic burger! Definitely on par with five guys and I would say it's even better. The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I've ever been to, a must try!

Also worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn't get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection."
sbQLXZiV_z44LSk0qEIy0Q,"So I was randomly in the area, I had some time to kill waiting for someone so Zeal  Burgers was in area,  claiming they were great gourment burger and after having the Z Burger I cant say I disagree

The Z burger was a double cheese burger, two fresh grilled 4 oz patties, topped with their onion ""stringer"" Which is their take on mix between fried onion and onion rings, so it still is deep fried but not as large as onion rings, which is tasty add with their z sauce it was an amazing burger"
PDK0KXnGm7GVUpige9nAQA,"Ordered the ""Sorry, Eh"" burger with fries and it was a really solid burger. It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable. Although a bit pricy ($10-15 usd) I would highly recommend this place."
8x174dIsUo1-VdYqHUKSjg,"Loved these burgers!  Fresh ingredients, flavours mesh perfectly for a mouthwatering experience.  My kids loved the fries and their cheeseburger. My husband devoured the spicy burger even though he ""wasn't hungry"" and I loved my feta.  We will go back often.  The owner is a great guy, made us feel really welcome as we had just moved to the city."
bays9EorJBAnRl0W3w12DQ,"Good food, good people, good prices. About 14$ for double patty and a couple extras and fries 

The parking is a bit tricky if you don't wanna pay since the location is located on a main street"
ABeny93AMSYm7Hn8UXPrRQ,"My go to place to study!  They play great music at a volume where you can still hear yourself think.  It's almost never crowded, and the people that come there generally are reading or studying.  They have an amazing tea collection, with equally good food and even grilled cheese sandwiches (with the option to add tomato :) )  One of the walls has some cute benches that are padded, making it a perfect place to wrap your hands around your warm cup of tea and read a book.  I agree with Rachel C, I wish they had high tea, that would make it perfect!  The only drawback is that it's small, and there aren't a lot of places to sit.  If you are the mood to try a variety of tea, or just need a place to study/relax this is it!"
KiGRD0ZhuDF1K1xLc0jjGA,"This place is ridiculously cute, colorful, and cozy, with a huge selection of loose leaf teas.  They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.

The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!

My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.

One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.

You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!"
nGV40rXMRL_IN6lWpyrsmA,"You can purchase from a huge variety of loose leaf teas. It's one of the few places I know that really pays attention to brew times and water temperature. The smoothies are fresh and taste very natural. If you order in, they'll give you your drink in a cup that looks smaller than if you order to-go. They have nice metal counters with lots of plug in places for your laptop. The benches aren't terribly comfortable, but the couches are. Plus, the people behind the counter are great!"
8FvVPvTaMJAM5drD18JxAA,"I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.

When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.

My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!

While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!"
CBamcMDNj6fCU5JbkRFgfw,"Came on a weekday afternoon to study and it was a good environment to do so. I got salmon sushi for a great price, and the pots of tea with free refills are a great deal too. The employees are friendly and attentive. This place seemed like a nice casual place to spend a few hours studying, and I'd definitely recommend it to others."
9bdoZr1hs6ATyKNQPrRUYg,"Amazing people 
Loveeee the owners. Best sushi in town best service and nothing beats their prices 
Good for bubble tea lovers"
FuESGmmv_tsmKERvHQXXjg,"This place hasn't changed a bit. Still awesome tea, great service and friendly faces. Although, the owners have changed, Te Cafe remains the same. 

So good to be back and sipping on my favorite iced lavender lemonade."
uKl2HGMPzg2CazrvXYC6YQ,"Mulled Apple Cider Tea. Deliciousness in a hot steaming cup.

Lots of space to lounge in. Friendly service."
-p0bL6keK6bJ963Z6MycJg,First visit here the other evening and it turned out to be the perfect place to sit and relax after a long busy day at work.  I didn't even look over  the tea selections because this café had me the minute I saw the featured drink listed on their outdoor sidewalk sign.  I thoroughly enjoyed sipping  my  hot cider tea drink on  the cozy corner seat near the window while reading and watching the world pass by.  Truly a good place to unwind and be refreshed.
ziGTjPAhjPkmb3KUvntfZg,"LOVED THIS PLACE.

It's like a coffee shop (/it is a coffee shop ha), but also has sushi. Good vibe and fairly quiet, which I always appreciate. There were about 5 other people working in here when my friend and I stopped in for lunch - and it's sad that this is rare - but everyone respected the fact that everyone else was working and stayed reasonably quiet.

The sushi rolls were good and priced well for sushi. They were a good size too, which meant I ate just the right amount of food for lunch by ordering one roll with a seaweed salad.

The best part for me was by far the service. Very friendly throughout my whole experience. As my friend and I were leaving, the people behind the counter even asked us if needed anything else. We said we were all good and they sent us off with a ""have a good day"" and a smile."
Zu4Xl5Ab4h6XhpbkGfiEGQ,"This place doesn't even need anymore 5 star reviews. But it's just so damn good that I had to.

The employees and owner(s?) are soo nice and recommended some pretty good teas! They also have a convenient water boiler where you can refill your own pot. 

Their sushi is spot on. Honestly, better than some sushi places around the area.  The ambience is really nice, although wish their tables were a tad bit bigger. Still, a great place to study!"
ImmGjseTAFTfhgcLIKKspg,"Te Cafe has an extensive selection of teas including dozens of green and black teas as well as a few other variations; you can also order coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries. In terms of ambiance, it is one of the coziest establishments that I have been in making it an ideal place to read, study, or complete some work. It's also a nice venue to meet up with a friend for a pot of tea and some quiet conversation. There are also some board games (including Chess, Backgammon, and Dominoes among several others)"
E0mubEQsoe-Ag84dF4RWPw,"I came here with a friend and her young child for my first visit.  What a nice and friendly place!  The staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend.  I ended up getting a white tea which was nice.  

The cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench).  I believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs.  In addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children!  My friend's child ahd the time of his life.  

I'll definitely be going back!"
f_rTGnBD1UvYKUp77xipIw,"Went here with my girlfriend and really enjoyed this place. Great atmosphere. I'm not that into tea, but I had a couple cups from the pot my gf ordered and enjoyed it. We ordered 2 biscotti, a medium coffee and a pot of tea (which comes with a free refill) and it cost just over $7. The Barista was really nice and helpful."
3zrel1UtG993XTc9BcVq5A,"This is a cute little shop that you might miss if you're not paying attention. The person behind the counter was very helpful and the tea I ended up getting was very delicius. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, it's worth stopping in."
46TNgyRfXo8NP5hydQFD_Q,"Good tea, comfy chairs.  I hear the food is also good, but have not tried it.  Nice quiet place to relax."
5Lz5wCZiKd28fXYDV1p36A,"With wireless internet and a relaxing ambience, this was a place I was looking for during my two years in grad school.  Coffeehouses in Pittsburgh often were too loud and rickety uncomfortable chairs.

The owners are often attentive and bring a certain unique warmth to the place.  Sure, a large part of the cafe is devoted to them.

I loved coming here for an after-dinner conversation with a friend or for studying.  Normally I would order a pot of darjeeling or a green tea.  Great selection of teas.  Very attentive service.  They give you a timer to help you remember how long to steep the tea.  The cups are all selected for the particular type of tea being served.

When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed.  Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat.

Still, when I visit Pittsburgh, I will return to this place."
A2ONjv4-0-RbzUScRHTEJQ,"I'm writing from Te Cafe right now.  I love this place and always made an effort to come here when I was visiting Pittsburgh from other locales.  It's sad that I don't come out here more often, now that I live here again...

Anyway, they have a fantastic beverage selection (not just tea), high-quality loose-leaf teas you can buy by the ounce, comfortable enough seating, free wifi, and friendly staff.  The music's a toss-up; right now, it's some pretty good oldish rock, but apparently there is ""wispy Lillith fair crap,"" sometimes?  On the bright side, if you show up on a bad day, it is definitely quiet enough to allow you to just listen to your own on headphones.  And the clientele is pretty varied, which I also rather like."
s8USKjytCBnirArAjujQsA,"Stopped by Te when I was in Pittsburgh and loved it.  Quaint little place in Squirrel Hill with a fantastic selection of loose teas.  The staff knows their teas and is friendly/helpful.  And the atmosphere is comfortable and neighborly.

If you're new to tea, this is a great place to get started and learn more.  And if you're a tea veteran, you'll be happy with the variety.  Cream Earl Grey is delicious, as well as peppermint rose."
YtMoh__UWg9x-frr43bqTg,"Te Cafe is going to be one of my favorite places in Squirrel Hill.  I feel it.

So here is the quick summary:
-  Loose leaf teas served by the cup or pot at reasonable prices!  Cups of tea were around $2, and I got a pot of peaches and cream tea for $4.01 with tax.  The Cream Earl Grey is amazing as well!  There is also free hot water so you can keep going!

- If you are not a hot tea drinker, there is also iced tea, lemonade, and hot chocolate!

-They sell grilled cheese sandwiches with pesto for $4.50 ish.  I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that the pesto grilled cheese was amazing.

-This place gets packed with wifi hogs.  You've been warned.

I really like the vibe of this place.  It's a good place to catch up with a friend or study, and I like that it's on the quiet side of things.  They usually are out of most of the teas on the menu, but there are still at least 50 types.  I will definitely be returning here soon!"
tzUnUNWTxqTS_NgpAGePBA,"Not as fancy as Dobra Tea across the street but it's a comfortable place to meet people work, study, read comma or relax. They have a great selection of Teas and coffee the staff is personable and if asked will give her a recommendation without a lecture about tea."
xawyoCQGgQkUcLQm3hW6MQ,"Love how they serve their tea if you get a pot of tea. It's also a great study spot, especially since you can get sushi for lunch here. I usually get the spicy tuna roll, and it's a pretty large portion size. There are plenty of plugs and the wifi is usually pretty good too."
aJXNCEdwEfSJk8E9o6BEhw,"Huge fan of Te!  Always a great experience every time I come.  The atmosphere is cozy, nice friendly staff who all know what they are talking about.  Not sure what to order? they will for sure help you out!  I'm a fan of Dragon Pearl Jasmine...yum!  Great place to read a book, do some work, or just hang out with friends.  

They have awesome fruit smoothies, made with REAL fruit!  I've gotten them for breakfast a few times, also NYC famous H&H bagels, you cant go wrong grabbing something on the go here.

I get some tea to take home from time to time, there are tons to pick from its hard to choose!

Their daily teas are always changing and are a great way to try something you may not think you would have chosen yourself.

All in all I think Te is great, I don't how they do it but they do it well."
rtlv8tD24Gila1o6_aHOPQ,"Certainly up there as one of my favorite spots in town to study.  The overall ambiance is very conducive to being productive: comfortable chairs, good lighting, a great selection of music at the appropriate volume, and of course the warm tasty beverages that are an absolute steal.  This place has the most robust hot chocolate lineup I have ever seen, with the Mexican chocolate being my favorite.  Free wi-fi, with no necessary password, makes things all the more convenient.  I also love how this place caters to those who want to study/read.  Sure light conversation does occur, but I hope it stays that way such not to detract from the great study vibe this place engenders."
R8SVECqA0rWwa0FCd-ViNg,"I came in for the first time, sat down to setup my computer, and within 2 minutes had a server telling me that if I do not order anything I will have to leave. I'm not sure if I was being judged by the way I looked (wearing sweatpants and ratty t-shirt), or if this is standard practice. I was planning on staying and purchasing a drink, but found this treatment extremely rude and uncomfortable. Do not plan on returning."
gTYNjQmNvUC6cIKaYaRo2w,"Amazing place to read or just relax, lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Some of their lower priced teas aren't thrilling (especially the greens) but you get what you pay for. 

The only problem I see arising is, if you buy a pot which is the best deal, you get a neat tray that comes with a timer, a cup for drinking, and a cup to hold the used leaves. If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead. I might be mistaken but they really should have party tray type tea sets. 

Still, 5 stars for sure. Excellent service, eclectic music (classical one day, indie the next), good ambiance, good price, decent hours (I wish they would open a bit earlier, but they close so late that it makes up for it), and some really amazing teas mixed in. Free wifi makes it even better."
4TLx9EUZOPuej3FhT1p4eQ,"Great selection of teas. sushi are fresh, but I don't like the sushi rice they used, much sticky than I thought for sushi rice"
Zfb77iqBJKxZutGh0nud9w,"I'm a graduate student here in Pittsburgh, and this is one of two main places I go when I want to get work done. The tea selection is excellent, and the staff was excellent - everyone knows the teas very well."
3HDCrtkYkoBK93AQWd4hVQ,"I only wish they offered sugar. However, good atmosphere. If you wanted to have a decent conversation with a friend of interest, this place is currently ideal. The Chai is amazing."
oVfKbZcICdgZatDWd_MtSg,"A neighborhood gem.  Don't come here looking for lattes or other fancy coffee drinks, though - it's a TEA shop.  The sushi is pretty good by Pittsburgh standards (no offense, Pittsburgh, but sushi ain't your strong suit).  It's bright and sunny, which is a huge plus, but that means it can get a little warm; layer appropriately."
6XwvR5K_VNsK3bJia4BPQw,"Oh what wonderful, delicious, unique drinks they have! I'm a tea person and I was extremely impressed by their selections (with prices better than Teavana, mind you). It's small but beautiful (think Ikea beautiful). And damn good people work there. :)"
pItymWcrt6jB6h_vZCtusQ,I love Te Cafe. I buy loose leaf tea here and also like to come in and occasionally drink a pot with a friend or my fiance. The atmosphere is great. I love it here.
26jzh7o4_D5ifUIPwqn_-g,"I have trouble ordering tea when I'm out because it's such a simple thing to make. I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.

However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the ""Kokeicha"". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of ""gunpowder"" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the ""Kokeicha"" was very similar.

The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.

Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?"
zFYHaBth2JyaK2VaTyzF1w,"Great selection of fairly-priced teas. Good food, too. Could be bigger, but never had a problem finding a comfortable seat. Not much to say, check it out!"
DnOWvfCUtGZlfiAJm13b0g,"This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh.  The ambiance is nice, somewhat modern and chill, but still comfortable.  There are board games available for playing, but most people seem to either be there with one or two other people to chat, or on their laptops making use of the wi-fi. The staff is very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, and if you need help picking something, will ask you questions to figure something out - green or oolong?  floral or fruity? - and then bring out several teas for you to smell before choosing one.  My favorite so far is the silk oolong, which is a smooth and slightly creamy oolong tea.  I also really like the tea cups they use for Chinese teas."
g9vdZh-qikRXXqlTZq_l_g,"Te Cafe is one of my favorite spots in Sq. Hill! In the winter, the windows are usually nice and foggy, providing the coziest feel when you're settling in with a hot cup of tea. They also have a nice selection of pastries and sushi, so you can snack or have a tasty meal while you're there to compliment your drink. Their chai tea latte is deeeeelicious as well, highly recommended! Great prices, great service, great food & drink :)"
2PKj9KBB4qSNW4hFl9TNKw,"Really delicious tea and a good atmosphere. Everyone who works here are nice and helpful. I never feel rushed when I work on my computer. The owners are also great, and bring a nice sense of community to Squirrel Hill when you walk in. 

I tried the Sushi here for the first time, and was surprised that they made it on site. You get a lot for $8-$9, and it tastes yummy. Would recommend. 

The mulled tea is my favorite though. I'll miss it in the summer."
D7N8Fw8WxsZT86S__k00tg,"Good selection of tea, plentiful seating, nice atmosphere. I had an iced hibiscus tea that was pretty great. I will definitely be returning.

Also, they have outdoor seating (though it's on the Murray Ave sidewalk and a little noisy) and a clean bathroom."
uV0ElhSj-gNRWqlHppN8fQ,The best hidden gem sushi in pittsburgh! Great tea selection also.. highly recommend for delicious inexpensive delivery sushi
9mvAc-aujfSYPP-2K6-3Lg,"Perhaps one of the best tea/cafe experiences in Pittsburgh. Hands down, this place is off the charts. The ambiance, employees, and tea are the best in Pittsburgh. Their selection of tea is impressively large. The cafe is also a great place to study."
nXUw865N8wCXCoS0sWzQEQ,"I can't think of a better to way to spend a lazy sunday afternoon than a pot of oolong, a copy of the sunday times, and just sitting back and relaxing at the Te Cafe."
c_IJF6qqXY8f2wjPGt5EKA,"I've come here twice and have to say their tea selection is fantastic. There are so many different kinds of teas and I appreciate the variety they offer in terms of food + ambiance + teas. 

I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it. I was hoping it would be better since they do specialize in tea but I do realize that doesn't necessarily mean their bubble tea would be good since in my opinion that is a whole different category.

I would come back strictly for their hot teas but definitely not the bubble tea."
JB8Nwp6J-jX-jiQbWPfn3g,"Every tea and tea-related concoction I have had here has been great. The atmosphere is bright and warm. They must have taken the other poster's music complaint into account, because I have heard a wide variety of great stuff every time I have been in there.

The staff is always super-friendly (without being annoying) and the clientele is usually a good mix of studying students/laptop users and people actually having conversations.

In short, good tea, good tea-related creations, good service, good music, good place to study or have a chat."
AyHH7u7bFe6EIGa5309bCg,"Te Cafe does tea well.They have an outstanding selection of teas, and they are very careful with brewing and all of that.

They also have a nice selection of board games and big tables to play on, which is a nice addition.

One thing kills it for me: the music is ABYSMAL. New age, strummy folky wispy Lilith fair crap every time. I still keep coming back from time to time when I have a tea craving but WOW."
RBEoSzBeoqAaEXfxYlrzRw,"Even if you're not in the mood for something from Te Cafe's diverse tea selection, there are plenty of other drinks that satisfy: tea lattes, lemonades (both plain and with unusual flavors like ginger, lemonade and hibiscus), hot chocolates and more.  The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations.  The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people.

The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do.  It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin.  Grilled cheese sandwiches and vegetable soup are recent additions to the cafe's menu.  While the soup is clearly from the can, it and the grilled cheese are nourishing.  I definitely appreciate not having to pack up all my study materials and leave in search of a decent meal.  

I really like the feeling of community that Te Cafe fosters with an area for posters and fliers for upcoming local events and work by local artists on the walls.  The cafe also hosts occasional poetry readings, but unfortunately I've never been able to attend one."
ODzDGcRzGUw2J-Yvxfjz9Q,"This is my favorite place to go in Squirrel Hill. There's so many different drink and tea options, I have to keep going back to try everything! The atmosphere is really nice and chill too- perfect for reading, sketching, studying, etc. I only wish there were more pastry/dessert options, other than just tarts and biscotti. It may actually be a good thing (for my wallet) though... haha."
lvMMuZZqR6uQ79O-XcfjXw,"Started going to the Te' when they first opened. The two ladies that run the place are very nice and good to talk to.

The teas are excellent! I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent.

The atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done.

I don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there.

Seriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place."
6kpcse53pqmuKjwuCrKy5Q,"They have outlets almost everywhere and the seats are extremely comfortable. I had a Kyoto Cherry Rose tea that was absolutely incredible. The staff really knows their tea, the presentation is wonderful, and the atmosphere is beyond pleasant. They also have a few board and card games. Go for work or a game night with friends!"
0Hv-VzdIdn-oraQfIvBKCA,"This place is super cute! I went here with my bestie (visiting from CBus) and she said it reminded her of Zen Cha, which I can see. You can order pots of tea, sushi, other drinks and real meals! We got a pot of their Apricot black tea to share. It had enough for about 2 refills and the set it came with was adorable! Taste was rich and fruity and made me want to go back for another flavor!

My friend got their sashimi bowl and it looked awesome! It made a nice, light lunch for her and the price wasn't outrageous. I see that they have crepes too so will definitely have to drag the hubs here to order all new stuff! 
They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere. 

Some other reviewers mentioned this but the smell of this place really wasn't appetizing--must be due to the combo of fish + tea? The owners were nice enough but they don't start selling their savory dishes until after a certain time which was not listed on the menus. So don't come here too early on the weekends!"
3p37CToxlfadSTt5-sSBqA,"Delicious green tea latte and tea mulled apple cider. Cozy atmosphere, generally quiet, would recommend for reading or studying and enjoying good tea."
BMhy7jzIDZThq8ft4R_K1A,Nice basement/attic feeling where it feels like it's probably what your house feels like
xUq3iv0vyx4_sAhPX4GQ4Q,"I can't believe all this time I did not write a review for Té Cafe. Since I came to Pittsburgh 4 years ago, this place has been my favorite location for some serious work. Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself. 

They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from.

If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you. 

Side warning:  I love the comfy chair and I'll give you mean stares if you happen to occupy it :)"
hHbG4oTPwLcrl2MZ20Af0Q,"I love this place, it's become my go-to take out sushi place. The owners are very friendly people, the atmosphere is charming and quiet, the tea is very delicious and varied, and the sushi is excellent at a cheap price. I come here at least once a week now."
1Y61Yy0hZtv4jzTqlUh4-w,"I love buying a pot of tea and studying here. It's always quiet, there's a ton of outlets, and you can always get free refills of hot water. It has a great, relaxing environment. Their lavender lemonade is great as is their plum berry white tea. I wish they had more room. The one thing they can definitely improve upon is their bathroom. The toilet is almost always broken and it never seems too clean."
0ZZXh9XpkNnuUyHEP1jmHA,"Not a tea drinker myself, but I stumble in here about three or four times a year to buy tea for my mom for various gifts. Every time I've been in, the staff's  been great with suggestions, samples, patience, etc. Went in again yesterday, and again...totally great. For being a clueless meathead, I was treated with no condescension, just the barista's enthusiasm for tea.  

One of the good businesses in Squirrel Hill I'm happy to support."
rfqHyUT7f0mJIvB7qFQc3w,"I recently  moved away from Pittsburgh, but this is one of the spots I miss the most. I spent many hours here working on my thesis, but also many hours here just hanging out with friends or reading a book. The people who work there are very friendly and very patient. When I first started stopping in, I knew very little about tea, and they always took the time to explain different properties of each type of tea and were able to make thoughtful suggestions for things they thought I should try based on my current mood and goals for the day.

One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter.

The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop. The atmosphere is inviting, and only rarely would it be too crowded to find a place to sit. The wi-fi was much more reliable than other places in the area.

I love this place! If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh, I'm going to make it a point to stop in. Keep up the great work!"
mp70-GC6K-GUWhr0zhMVzg,"This is my favorite cafe in Pittsburgh. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, I prefer drinking tea or smoothies if I'm sitting at a cafe and Te Cafe is perfect for that. It's a very chilled out place, got big windows and all kinds of seating. It's not the fanciest cafe around, which is actually nice, because it has a very comfortable vibe to it. They have free and unlimited wifi. The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there.

They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins.

Great place, check it out!"
B-f8PvfKHiMus0vkeB--6A,Really interesting tea flavors. Stop by if your in the neighborhood.
GINnZIuD2_Y2gbnVvPn2AA,"That's my second time here, and I'm so happy that i've discovered that place! Very comfortable and relaxing atmoshere, delicious teas and huge variet varieties them! Friendly, always kind and heping stuff! That's one if my favorite places now!!!!"
kMfF-7-zB65p7fTf79CWbA,"Aw, I love it. It looks like a really great study area. I would come here to study. Also they give you a pot of tea with free hot water refills. That would be perfect for studying. Also, the guy working there was really helpful with suggestions. And the place inside is just super chill."
kPF3A3_90Q76Z3-zjWkn9A,Can't vouch for the sushi as I only stopped by for a lunch time snack.  Tried the sandwich of the day which was a grilled cheese pannini and I have the iced chai latte.  Both were tasty and reasonably priced.  Staff was friendly and place was clean and comfortable.  If I was living in this area I could see myself coming in here on a pretty regular basis.
DfHmJy7B_IiOZtF4fOBizg,"With a calm, peaceful atmosphere, a very friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a wide selection of great quality products, I would definitely recommend this place.  Both the iced chai tea latte and the sparkling tea were excellent, and I'm sure that their other stuff is great too.
I'm definitely going to have to make a point of coming back."
4MwWqMejF_5Lm3HJlPvjFA,"I wouldn't have guessed that a tea cafe would sell sushi but my friend recommended to try this place. Ordered the Twin City Roll which had tuna, salmon, avocado, and cucumbers. There was more sushi than rice so the ratio was good. The sushi looked good and I thought the price was reasonable. But when I was eating it, the sushi didn't seem fresh. There was a strong fish smell and the aftertaste left a slimy feeling on my tongue. The interior of the cafe also had a weird smell... I don't know how to describe it exactly. I don't think sushi and tea smells go well together? I don't know if I would recommend coming here for sushi. Maybe their tea is better as it is a tea cafe."
7hqzqymiaqoo1QwWB2x38A,"I've been shopping at this mall since I was a child and in the last couple years they've really outdone themselves by doing a total makeover and renovation. The whole interior is a lot more trendy and reflective of our times and the big name brands and boutiques that have settled in the Mail.
Everything is a glossy white marble, clean and sleek.  Lots of natural sunlight coming from glass rooftop openings. The food court is also impressive, they've expanded the seating area by shutting down one of the stores on the side. Color combination and lighting makes this place a whole lot more appealing.

Since the building of the Dix 30 mega outdoor shopping lifestyle complex, Mail Champlain has had to renew itself to retain shoppers. The opening of the Forever 21 store was one of their best moves. They also appeal to a higher class of shoppers with big brands like BCBG and Browns shoes. Even The Bay has undergone a slight revamp - on the main floor, they've rearranged their handbag and shoe department to make way for name brands.

I used to see mostly elderly people wandering around during the week, it didn't seem like a popular hangout place for youngings but that has changed.

Mail Champlain has a bit of everything for all ages, tastes and budgets. The only thing missing might be a pharmacy, they used to have a Jean Coutu but it closed down."
i53uVRYpoPibBn4fUy1iDA,"une de mes places préférées pour magasiner sur la Rive-Sud ! Surtout pendant l'hiver puisque c'est intérieur donc pas besoin de geler au coton en changeant de magasins!! Il y a beaucoup de boutiques dont un H&M, un forever 21, un Archambault, etc! Il y a aussi plusieurs fast food pour te rassaisir après une bonne journee de magasinage intensive ! Il manque cependant quelques boutiques phares tel un Simons, mais ça fait l'affaire pour une virée shopping dans ton heure de lunch :) !!"
xHoTpyWyefqfpCA6KaElPQ,"Though this mall is smaller and less variety compared to others around it, I still love to come here as there are a few shops which are not in Promenade St Bruno. The food court is OK, not the best but the mall is cute and easy to navigate around. I love the Yves Rocher here, great little salon inside. Also the fact that there is a huge sirens store here which has way more variety than Dix30. When the weather is like today (raining) we end up at this indoor mall instead of the outdoor Dix30 and love the atmosphere here. 
It was the first mall I visited in Montreal so I hold many fond memories of the place :)"
t9Ay7vjt_FkLRyfDVrbfXQ,This is my 9 year olds review.     Hamburgers are great and the cheese curds are awesome.   There is a Great Lake View
DoOr0Vsn9cxwzU9M-HPQFQ,"So I know Christy's is a Madison tradition with those lovely views of Lake Waubesa. But this place is a one-track pony... location, location, location. This is a family-owned bar/restaurant and the owners know they have a captive audience. The beer is cold and the food is average, but the service is atrocious. On a recent beautiful Saturday afternoon, there were only two servers for the outside seating area.  There's no host, so we (4 adults and 1 kid) sat at a picnic table and proceeded to wait at least 10 minutes to no avail. We eventually went inside to order drinks and lunch. At no time during our visit did a server ever approach our table. I'd certainly be inclined to write off this awful experience to a bad day or poor staffing, but unfortunately this is more the rule rather than exception. One really weird thing is the Friday Fish Fry that features a special menu available ONLY inside, this isn't communicated very well;  so you'll grab a table outside, wait to order only to learn you can only order from the pizza/sandwich menu."
C7d9s1Oo2wtPkMh6JvQDoA,Great scenery. Solid food. Great energy! A must in the summer!!
KhuDGyZaiRQ7ogBWGHqYgg,This place has such potential but the service SUCKS! And I wrote that in capital letters on purpose. You literally have to stare a waitress down and even if you make eye contact you're lucky if they will stop at your table. Come on! We boat on the lake and wish there were better options than this. I guess it's Waypoint every time! As a side note: I'm writing this on a Sunday afternoon as I've been sitting at an outside table for over 15 minutes without one of the three servers currently working even acknowledging us! I really wanted the Shrimp Christy's. (Because it's fantastic!) Oh well. There probably won't be a next time either!
qqiIYIsE_6eKjeLRn004VQ,"Unless you're a local yokel McFarland douchebag, you won't get any measure of service here.  After waiting more than 15 minutes for a server outside, I went inside to inquire of outdoor food service.  Of course, since I am not one of the regular inebriated bar flies, getting the attention of a bartender is nearly impossible.  I guess I'm just not loud enough, drunk enough, or both.  And once I did get his ear, the next local loudmouth douche bag stumbles up to the bar and interupts me to order his next round of Captain and Cokes (classy).  So we left and will never be back...unless of course we lose all sense of decency and purpose and relocate to McFarland."
c3Qu6sAMJTOgwyjnWbFhMQ,"Great volleyball courts! The sand is soft but at night, some of the lights will shine right in your face and obstruct your view while you're playing.

There is a hose and area to rinse off afterwards, by the dock facing the beautiful, glistening Lake Waubesa.

A cherry bomb will run you $7 and a Vodka 7 will run you about $5 or so.

Be careful when you order the pizza, you start with either a 12"" ($8.99) or 16"" ($10.99) cheese and each topping is $1.50! My friends and I weren't aware of that and got a little carried away when we got our tab for all the drinks, pizza and wings was just under $100!

On Monday nights they have a AYCE taco bar with ground beed and chicken, as well as assorted toppings. The pico de gallo was very fresh, the shredded romaine was crisp, and the salsa had a nice bite to it. Every time you were ready for more, just ask the nice bartender to give you more shells (corn hard shell or soft flour tortillas)."
UtsYhJchMT1Y_JsB9SU_5g,"Great food, great environment, low key, full bar plus a tiki bar in the summer! Best nachos I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Overall just a chill, consistently great place that in the summer is the place to be if you like the sun lake and boating. Been looking for a place like this"
RUdGyQeJuddLPu6FqE12lw,"Menu is short. Excellent black bean veggie burger and seasoned waffle fries.  Old fashioneds are made from scratch/muddled.  I had excellent service while there--nice, competent bartender came outside to refill drinks several times.  It was a comfortable experience, relaxing outside watching the waves.  Veggie people beware taxidermied animals inside."
4ed5B3N9Y8Cuo2bnm43Nig,"Good food, drinks, and views.  Great place to come by boat in the summer!"
2KoVbCwHp49aUnvflElEbw,"Enjoyed a beautiful day on the patio last Sunday listening to the Blue Olives (they're great!) and sipping beer. Ordered the nacho's and was fully disappointed-a somewhat small pile of flavorless corn tortillas and minimal cheese, chicken, peppers, and a clump of black olives. It appeared to have been placed briefly under a hot broiler as the top was charred and any buried shredded cheese was unmelted. The result was a very dry dish that required multiple cups of salsa to provide flavor and moisture.

Note: This review was written during the summer of 2014 but I just found it in my Drafts-- sorry for the delay!"
iurpwMMbZ3CeNDd9GX1JIg,"Love going here during the summer.  Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching.  Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh.  Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall."
eYxRUyzyPkQJ63ypRjVHqQ,"I have been to Christy's quite a few times over the years and have never had a very good meal; however, last night's meal was a disaster! It started with the bartender getting our drink order wrong, One member of our party received a different potato than ordered, 1 had a different salad dressing than ordered and I had the worst fish fry EVER. It could have been good if the breading wasn't soggy on one piece and excessively crispy with holes in it (looked exactly like a funnel cake!). The baked potato tasted dry and leftover. The one high point was a waitress (first night on the job) that was very friendly and actually cared about our poor experience. Christy's is back on my list of places to avoid."
E1pjnmEX71QOZvDAGx3gJA,"I'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews. We were made to feel very welcome as soon as we sat at the bar by Tim the bartender. He was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. It made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. 

Starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. The toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. The only drawbacks I can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that I'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to Madison, like Ale Asylum, Karben4, or even Tyranena (from Lake Mills).

As we left Tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. I 100% plan to do so."
Fzg9uXBGOZgrEZO53W5diQ,Decent but not great.  OK as far as bar food goes.  Very smokey.
ZDZ7Nu88u4jwIG1Yh_5KrA,"Worst service ever. we arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night. Since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1-1/2 hour wait.  We sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. At the 1-1/2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. Maybe the upstairs dining was busy? Nope- one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. We think they just forgot us.
Brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). Soup was good. Salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks.
30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was ""didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?"" Wouldn't that be the waitress' job? After another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. Bartender blew me off, so I went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they ""were just catching up"". From what? The bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area.
5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. We will not be back. Maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it."
NyWxv3NWZGkRym94DN8jOA,"I've been here a few times. The cheese curds and fries are nice. Onion rings ok.  Wings my kids love but I think they are too smothered in sauce. Each time I've been here It was by boat so we've sat out side. I would have rated it a 3 or 4 except each and every table has an ash tray which is gross and they allow smoking in the entire area. My kids 6 and 11  were with us and one has asthma so we had to move to get out of the smoke. Very inconsiderate allowing smoking, only 3 out of maybe 40 people were smoking so maybe inconvenience 3 people and not everyone else. Going forward Ill probably just get takeout."
reRtpwsYPjGLyeCVAaOpLg,"We tried the fish fry a few weeks ago after hearing great reviews from friends. We weren't disappointed. Everything was wonderful. Tonight we went back and our experience was the opposite. The lobster bisque was cold ( Apparently, they forgot to turn the burner on and we were the first to mention it. We were there at 8:00pm.). The fish was okay and the waffle fries were cold. My husband asked why we didn't get any bread. He was told that they ran out. We found that interesting since people who were seated after we were had bread. Not sure we need to go back."
Eh9x3hf6bA6p1KNkNlMkPw,"Just got back from this restaurant for the third time. It is close to where we live and like the convenience of going there. This was the last time though. When we arrived we where told we needed to wait 5 to 10 mins for a seat. After 15 mins we where seated in a room with 10 open tables (not sure why we needed to wait).  About another 15 mins went by and 2 other tables where seated and served drinks and still no one waited on us.  No one ever did so we left. 

The other times that we have been the food is only mediocre for bar food at best."
FJ8RHbfzzbVg3hIB7QDdOg,"This place is good only for the outdoor atmosphere. Their online menu does not correspond to their actual menu, buy they don't seem to see this as a problem. I requested my favorite beer: ""Oh, we're out of that."" Then, my second favorite: ""We're out of that too."" As a vegetarian, I had to order a black bean burger, which was burned, as was the bun. I asked for a dark or spicy mustard. No, they just have the mainstream basics. Combine this with extremely mediocre service. I will never eat there again."
Y_DH_03zyYBmsLVkVaA0cA,"Unfortunately we had really high hopes for this place mostly because we noticed All You Can Eat Taco Bar on the website but apparently the websitr was not correct/up to date so we were left with other options. The waffle fries were delicious, wraps were average and a little pricey, and service was fair (even in the off season). Can definitely see the appeal during the summer but it won't be a place I seek for good eats and drink."
_slgwd3lV-935lVEYZHeYA,"I was actually quite surprised at how good the fish fry was.  I had some great hashbrowns with it and my wife really enjoyed the salad that accompanied the meal.  If you're a craft beer lover like myself, you'll be disappointed in their beer selection, but Christy's is worth a visit solely for their fish fry."
oHm8T7HOpB8CAy6aHpOZhQ,"Drove out on the bikes on a gorgeous Sunday.   It wasn't overly crowded.  Overlooks the lake and many people dock their boats and enjoy the patio and food.   Lots of people taking food back out onto their boats.  
Upon arriving, there is no sign telling you to sit down or see the hostess for a seat.  We walked around and into the bar and then we finally were told by the bartender that we can sit where we want.   
The menus at the table were all different.   Three different menus, one omitted the burger and the other one didn't have the ""baskets"" on it.  Weird!!  The waitress knew that something was wrong with the soda guns and brought us 2 pitchers of essentially colored water.  When we finally mentioned it, she acknowledged that they were having problems with it.  After a while she brought us another one and said she hoped it was better.  It finally was.   The orange and lemon peels thrown on the grass, could be cleaned up as well.  
Overall, the food was good.   Burger was juicy and flavorful and he bacon wrapped shrimp was really yummy.  The pizza at the table next to us looked delish and may be ordered if we return. 
The place has some potential but a little makeover would be great!!!"
8ia9RSWTgh-ZFqhftS8ylQ,"A great neighborhood hangout with good food and great beer.  This is THE place to be on a summer night, and usually something fun happening on the ice in the winter.  The place is loaded with character(s) and is a true Wisconsin tavern on the lake."
Vt4pYnSQuAP7005VZAU_pA,"Today I had another session with Les.  I was having so much pain in my foot I thought I was going to have to give up dance.  Les did a combination of multiple modalities on me including lymphatic drainage, chiropractic massage, Russian massage to realign my leg and foot.  I was very relaxed and even when he had to use more pressure on the reflexology, it was fine.  He diagnosed that I had a tight inner thigh muscle and he got it to release.  Les is so experienced and can read your body and diagnose where your physical issues are.  I am telling all my friends about his work!"
RWt3BFe73QHo-3HVqrHO_A,"Les is just incredible!!  I participate in a number of sports and work my muscles to the max.  A typical week includes 6 hours of high-intensity interval training as well as three to four 3-6 mile runs.  As a public speaker, I spend 8-hours per day standing on high heels.  Massage is not a ""luxury"" for me nor is it about relaxation - it is about allowing me to continue to do the things I love without pain.  Until I began going to Advanced Body Therapy, I did not think that was possible.  Les is fantastic in the office and encourages me to continue my active lifestyle by even showing me stretches I can do at home."
xmuu-dPRZtv2oMxGmCsvSQ,Les is the Masseuse Master. Had a Deep Tissue massage this morning and it was great!
eDYRSJ7YVMZ3mKd7_zv5tw,"Again.... Les has worked his magic on me. 
Just 1 visit & already I have less pain & more mobility in my injured knee."
onfGsGa0z59efaD6URgAEA,"A really good sandwich place. It's location is a little unusual but very convenient to the surrounding airport hotels. The turkey, avocado bot was great."
CI2hQUaR8KR8SGXvM1t0GQ,The food was definitely solid but what stood out the most for me was the friendly staff and the iced coffee they whipped up. Wish I had got their largest size. Highly recommended!
CsmCJ-2V3MyTYETirfBo0Q,Great place to grab lunch. The location is a little hidden. It's in an office building. There is shaded outside seating. The food was fresh and my sandwich tasted great. My only complaint was that the potato salad had too much dill in it.
hgovU_roMRHwRsYRdy0yYQ,"What a find, right behind the Radisson, fresh cheap and delicious.  Friendly staff. Give it a try."
40nKNzdl3ulfPRKVGDgz7g,"I work in a office building right around the corner from them.  The place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back.  Honest to God, the food is addictive.  My faves are the Italian Hoagie (reminds me of home back East) and the Chipotle Chicken sandwich.  And I also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it.

Staff is friendly too which makes the experience even better!

I'm a fan!"
rOC3Hs18POWCqbituKs0lg,I can't figure out why their food isn't that great. They seem to use good quality products. Been there for breakfast and lunch and its meh.
F4E_0pzw0uZLhuHLfLVudg,"Only open for lunch spot, a nice little sandwich shop hidden behind the Radisson. I had the Grilled Fiesta Chicken Wrap and really enjoyed it. Pretty large sandwiches from what I can tell and looking forward to trying other options, as well. Being from out of town, you can tell it has its regulars and people really like this lunch place."
97f1lNOtVnT25y_Qs1_PGA,"After arriving at PHX airport we searched for a nearby lunch option and this was well reviewed.  It was a little difficult to find.  It's hidden in a larger building with very little signage.  Also the parking lot has signs about hotel guests only etc.. so that was a little unnerving.  They were closing soon when we came in, but we ordered a BLT and a southwest chicken panini.  Both were ready quickly and were very good."
Y3y1EdnVyhtTdn0asawa9g,"I have visited The Lunch Lounge 3 times since one of their workers stopped by my office and dropped off a menu and some yummy cookies. The first time I wasn't sure what to expect so I got a Ceasar Salad hold the Ceasar please. It was okay, the chicken was good and none of the leafy greens were in bad condition. I guess I was expecting a wow factor when it came to the $6 salad I had received. they do brew Starbucks so I had decided to get one of my favorites. Hazelnut latte... only they were out of the Hazelnut Syrup. I instead got a caramel latte. Not my favorite, but it would do.

My second visit I was very excited to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Deluxe Roast Beef Press (only with 9 grain instead of sourdough) ! However when I arrived they had run of or roast beef, but I was told they were expecting their shipment to arrive tomorrow. Still hungry and not wanting to wait till tomorrow to eat I decided to try the Vegetarian Delight. $8.00 later my meal was... okay. Good sized, but in the end not what I was really hoping for when I had first came.

Today I went to give it one more try. I got the Sandwich ""your way"" which I ordered Roast Beef, imported Swiss, on 9 grain with Lettuce and Spicy brown mustard. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie and a Caramel Macchiato to wash it down. A total that came to $13.38. I arrived at my office and to my surprise my 9 grain bread turned into Sourdough - My least favorite bread... 

To say the least I really wanted to like this place, but I am not blow away by The Lunch Lounge. I have given them a 3 for effort. - Also to add I found out this last visit that they only have soup on Tuesday's"
R3gJ_j4bWlkO8QD32Di06A,"Happy to have found this place! Great food, decent prices, friendly staff. This makes me a more-than-once-a-week patron! And they will even accomodate an off-menu request as long as they have the ingredients. Thanks, Fred!"
uhxRYN8DsM2K1YWiuaTroQ,"I absolutely love this place! In fact, probably my favorite sandwich spot. A hidden gem. I eat here atlas once a week. I have yet to have one bad thing.  My favorite sandwiches are the Queen of Clubs ( like the King of clubs, but with only a double decker not a triple decker) and the tuna melt. The cobb and garden of eden salad are my favorites. Their sandwiches and salads are pretty big, so go with an appetite. Its a mom and pop sandwich shop, which I love. Try it out! You will not be disappointed!"
b7K6FGNibHQ6TH4j7feW6w,"Tucked in behind the Radisson at the corner of an office park, this is a great alternative to the food in the local hotels.

I had the Cobb salad. Despite the generic iceberg lettuce it was enhanced with fresh spinach, avocado and egg and everything else was fresh. Good dressing and generous portions.

As others have said come before noon or after 1 o'clock if you don't want to wait in line. Three nice tables outside with a little lawn view."
vsiKrkAlOXCEXiuN6SeF2w,"an excellent place for lunch, the food is great the service too! always friendly, never pushy, as one guy said, i like the 'tude of the lounge lady...i call it the the lunch lizard and its off the beaten path but you wont go wrong with thier specials or anything on the menu for that matter. the outside seating is nice, i try to eat here regularly...beats any chain sammich shop!"
bVF8fvEiLfs4pnVwvPJy5w,"i am not a fan of turkey so when i asked the sandwich guy for his recommendation, and he suggested the albuquerque turkey, i was unsure, nevetheless i went on to try it and boy! Was i glad? The sandwich comes with   fresh cole slawish salad, bacon cooked just right crisp and retaining its flavor, generous slice of turkey and to top it off chile mayo which is really what separates  this sandwich from the other diners... .all in all a great sandwich...made to perfection. I want to come here and try other items on the menu... They all look good....hopefully on my next trip to phoenix."
iCtyeCryz3FzGARhTjbEvA,"Great service in a quick-bite-to-eat, make-your-own-sandwich spot. Most of the business probably wanders from those office buildings. People looked lost and in their own heads as they would methodically make their way. It is a sunny day at 74° but it's clear that's it's Friday at the office.
Anyway back to the food-
Choices for breads cheese meats veggies
Chips and soda 
Pretty standard with more selections available too

Sandwich was well prepared and tasted as expected.

Note: Almost gave them four stars because the cashier is a Colts fan but we all make choices and their good service and food shouldn't suffer from his choice to root for the Colts. I joke, I joke. Also, Go Patriots. :)"
Hk33_V_Ltk708njGR-kT9Q,"Good food at a small lunch restaurant,  it is a good place to pick up lunch if in the area but it is not a destination lunch spot. More of a business man's quick stop."
nWk7otoD_ZL42bbbK4-jVg,I have been to the Lunch Lounge many times for lunch and love the chicken salad.  It is the best!  I also love the BLT's.  Today I stopped in for breakfast and had the breakfast panini sandwich and I am once again impressed.  Thank you Lunch Lounge!!!
kmZTkEDMApvsuRwBrbgWbA,"Ordered the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and it was still frozen in the middle.  FROZEN! I couldn't believe it; it took them a long time to have my order ready but still manage to not cook it all the way.  I didn't realize it was frozen until I got back to work to eat it.  By then, I didn't have time to return to have them make me a new one.

This is an expensive place for just sandwiches only.  My Panini alone was over $8 after tax.  Not a good value because it doesn't even come with a drink or side.  I appreciate and support local businesses whenever possible but after this mishap, I won't be back."
n3oI45ffNqHRriyyS8dY_Q,I eat here at least once a week all of their sandwiches and salads are always fresh and delicious and every 9 salads or sandwiches you buy you get the 10th on FREE. Goodstuff! Glad it's near my work.
0W5SEy35PV93rjcAj3X1bQ,"Love this place.  Weekly specials are amazing.  Great, fast, and friendly service.  I'd highly recommend to anyone."
vShpdW9kU92417H9HvigDA,Today I had the hot pastrami with on the side. The sandwich and the slaw: EXCELLENT!  The staff is great. I'm flying today so I also purchased a pb&j on grain bread for later.   I'm sure it will be awesome too.
GbzOy5nb6g9apvc5sb8lhQ,Excellent little hidden spot. Great menu with fair prices. Had the Breakfast burrito with a cup of coffee. Outstanding burrito! Loads of cheese & stuffings. The menu on yelp is a little outdated but the prices are more than reasonable. Definetly give this place a try.
RN6EcYhy7JzlTgiu1ku_4g,"Great sandwich shop near several airport hotels. They also serve salads at lunchtime, and breakfast starting at 7:00 AM. Alas, wasn't in town long enough to sample the breakfast, but lunch was fantastic. Small but very popular at lunch when I was there"
6WWIKC_GYHFZKKZ8-mCrSg,Had lunch here. Very close to work but only found out about it through yelp. My sandwich was delicious and the staff was super friendly.  I'll definitely be back.
nzIHJdGBbkLFeUCBflmzOQ,"For a little sandwich shop in an office park, this place is great. 

Delicious, big breakfast burrito.  No problem to substitute avocado for the meat. Hot tasty coffee. friendly staff. Outdoor seating option.

All for under $6.

So glad I didn't have the more expensive breakfast in my corporate airport hotel."
Xd7fDGNp6wc_8mjPs0Unvw,"I stumbled upon the Lunch Lounge while staying at the Aloft last week, and was thrilled that I did. It's kind of hidden from the street behind the Radisson on 44th St, but that didn't stop me from taking the short walk over from the hotel. Cute little place with great service and good eats! They have all kinds of sandwiches and salads, and couldn't decide what I wanted since the menu looked so good. They serve Boar's Head meats, which makes for an awesome sandwich. My friends who were staying with me raved about the food and said they wanted to come here for lunch again tomorrow. Only not so great thing was that they were out of the soup of the day, which we wanted to try, but since we did come about a half hour before they closed I could live with that. Wish we had more deli-type places like this in Milwaukee! Yummmmm!"
18RML0hSOiL4oWSpHefNfA,"What a find!  While staying at the Aloft in Phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.   

We had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  Both were excellent!  The burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.

The lunch menu looked great and I would like to try some of the sandwiches.

We are here for a few more days and will eat here on Monday.

If you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  You won't be disappointed."
x3Yy3gLYyTkd98_pH_ux8w,Excellent sandwich luncheon spot!  The Albuquerque Turkey Panini is fantastic!  Green chili mayo?  Who knew?  I had to buy some to go!  Fresh vegetables and Boar's head meat. Warning if you order a cold sub sandwich the bread is a bit too much.  It's loaded with goodies but it's too much bread.
gKMHY8pY2yLELjYqqa57ng,Great breakfast panini for $5. More affordable than a breakfast or brunch chain for sure. Nothing for breakfast is over $5 which makes this a spot I will recommend and more than likely come back to next trip. Iced coffee is only $1 till 11 and breakfast is served til 11.
F5Hj9ozgOJ6VILZGmNeY8g,Amazing lunch.  Fresh Boars Head meats. Fresh bread (marble rye is awesome) and tr staff is great.  One of the best sandwiches in the Phoenix area.  Don't miss this place. You won't be disappointed!
w4xgWD2tc9llQwqHl9C9kA,"Worth finding - a little awkward the first time, but I don't regret having to drive the block an extra time! The Italian sub was loaded with meat - just like back home (Boston) - salad was fresh, bread was fresh, meat was just YUMMY!! Nice surprise - we will all be back. BTW - lunch for 4 + drinks was $30.00 ... Great, clean, fresh and friendly!!"
GXtY_8FkuWCVfWjjBuHw9g,Food is good and location is convenient. Service is terrible - even the owner - the older woman acts like its an inconvenience to help people. We have had the opportunity to give her more business but decided against it because of the service. Don't waste your time.
RH2Hzv7_erHGpDlXMvYWdw,"Restaurant/Ambiance: Small cafe tucked away in a corporate office park. Has a Modern but relaxed cafe vibe inside. Has about 12 or so tables inside with 3 tables outside. Typical clients are business execs and tradespeople on lunch break. No issue getting a table or parking space. Little difficult to find though.

Food: Great selection of sandwiches. Quality meats and fresh veggies. I like the southwest chicken chipotle sandwich. Also excellent salad menu. They also have a great breakfast menu but I've never been there for breakfast.

Service: Fast service, able to move the lunch rush pretty well.

Overall: Great little lunch cafe!"
X3J4JtADK48m9DXjuWZmBA,"SImple to find and great custom made food. Sandwiches, Chips and Drink. No frills but delicious."
N0cm6cj-c3EWx5Y2FdkZNw,First time for breakfast. Waiting for someone at sky harbor. Breakfast burrito outstanding. A meal in a tortilla. Very tasty and really inexpensive. I'll be back!!
U6an2qDggnvuWWFMo6V2CA,"Great little local place with tasty food.  Be diligent in finding it as it isn't obvious from the main street.  Minimal seating for eat-in so plan ahead.  Friendly staff, good prices."
fdGbPDqSpnhjj1UdVyYdhg,"If you work in the area and have not been here, GO IMMEDIATELY!  I have worked across the street for 15 years and I am so thrilled to finally have good food in the area.  The Chicken Fiesta Wrap is my favorite (I CRAVE it) and the California Club is really good too (crispy bacon....yummmm). If you can get there before they run out of Tortilla Soup it is outstanding. The food is always consistent and they don't seem to cut corners. Reasonably priced for what you get and what's in the area. Fast service, wifi on site, nice staff...I seriously cannot say anything negative.  Thank you for saving our lunch dilemma in the area!"
CEyzTVZ2MD7mwhwxY5B6JA,"I picked this spot out because of Yelp. I was looking to walk from my hotel (Aloft) and it's just down the street. Pay attentuon to the signs. It's in the back of a building that blends in with the rest.
I had a Cobb salad and it was fresh and ready in about 3 minutes. Seemed like good friendly sevice. Portion was perfect and prices were reasonable."
2-g2Fhn2qAAYI0aaVPJKUg,Awesome find! Stopped in for breakfast on the run and will probably come back for lunch. The guys are super nice... Coffee is amazing!
A6vxSSNe2x2c_kdHtvF7hA,"Great little sandwich shop tucked into the office plaza (Follow the sandwich board signs to find it). I had the lunch roast beef special and it was really good. The red potato salad seemed to be missing something for my palate, but over all it was really good! Meat was tender, taste was good and no overpowering sauces. 

Its a bit cramped in there so a togo order is a good idea, but its close to my other office so it makes for a perfect stop. Service was fast considering the crowd at lunch and the patrons and employees seemed to know one another.

Its a nice place if you are in the area, stop by and have lunch!"
N75A6yCqjZk0hrthXcSbNg,"It is hard to locate but just look for a small sign stating there are just hiding in the back! (: The set up is nice with an option to eat indoors/outdoors although I wouldn't recommend bringing large parties. Customer service was good and the food was delicious! I had to go with the BLT which, they did not shy away with the bacon. I wouldn't mind visiting back for lunch again."
XcARF3jBueZcmXNyfr6gNQ,"I feel like this place has gotten worse over time, and it feels as every time I try to go back, they fail to meet the mark somehow. I used to frequent it when my work first moved into this area, about 4 years ago, but I think today was the draw for me. They forgot to include dressing with my $9 salad. Also, without the dressing, the chicken has a strange taste, almost questionable, which makes me wonder how it has tasted in the past...at least I got extra spinach. The initial reason I started going here less often was a noticeable decrease in their salad sizes a few years back, hence I ask for extra spinach. One good thing they have going for themselves is that the veggies they use in their salads always taste fresh, for that reason I gave them two starts instead of one. However, I expect better for the price they ask for their food. Today was my last visit and I will make sure to spread the word at work."
j6vBl6VAbNWnOszna9C2bA,Great little lunch spot!  Fresh food.  Something for everybody.  Long line at lunch though.  We had our food within 15/20 minutes from the line at the door.
LIFGdvp1ftt7FSknVReeGg,"Was in Phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful  haunt  near the airport.  I had the best lunch ever -  a Southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  OMG!  The guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned East coast deli.  

I had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my Lunch Lounge experience!  I made sure I had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile - all for less than my daily NYC latte and muffin.  

My  client has never been to The Lunch Lounge, so next time I am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in Phoenix!  I can't wait to share the secret!"
n4z4QbIaMv9feBBja7X3Tg,Tasty and fast.  They primarily serve the corporate crowd so keep that in mind if you visit during prime lunch hours.
eizIAeDy6K9bVFqjQ_j9mg,"I visited this restaurant because I got a groupon now deal. When I walked In and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that I was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..

Finally she said ""whenever your ready.."". I told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. That on its own turned me off because I hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  I don't feel like I am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. 

As I was standing waiting for my food I overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while I was standing there! Rude! 

The older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. He is the only reason I am giving two stars. 

The food on the other hand was decent. Too bad I won't ever becoming back just to be treated like I am bothering them.. next time I will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like I wanted anyways."
nN70gmUQEXvIJZedynlbwg,"Tucked away in a very boring looking business park, you can sneak in for a great sandwich. Go around the corner and look for the Boar's Head sign. I had the Thanksgiving lunch special - turkey, stuffing, cranberry jam, and I held off on the cheese. Nicely toasted bread - all in all, a decent lunch!"
SpJQn8ijiLFPs9n31XSJTg,"I had the Egg-Cellent Burrito. Its name is not representative of the taste. It indeed did have eggs, but not the greatest tasting. They pulled the burrito out of the microwave so I assume that's how they cook it. I'd recommend checking something else out next time."
hpX2k1MvzRAF8naLfaUYWA,"I stopped in last Friday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast burrito. The service was fast, and not only was the breakfast burrito reasonably priced, but it was also enormous."
sQYnC14kF_Hkubr6x-zPvQ,Yum! Good food and they deliver on Amazon Restaurants! I will certainly be ordering again. I was particularly happy with the carb free option for breakfast. We had a happy breakfast crowd.
C4J79LVbr991w48PzKy9yw,Awesome meal.  Very willing to make adjustments and recommendations. Would come back here in a heartbeat.
LRwvRtyuITMr8juNqBGe9Q,"This place is ridiculous! Wasn't expecting much from a deli sandwiched between office buildings, but wow! This place is just across the street from where I work and everyone is blown away by the food. The staff is super friendly and the food is really fresh. The owner took my order a few weeks back and recommended the Stromboli since I always ordered the Roast Beef Press (which is fantastic!). O. M. G... the Stromboli is the best sandwich I've ever had. Inside out sub roll, pesto, ham, pepperoni, salami, cheese, and cherry peppers - toasted on a panini press. Seriously? On my day off from work, I drove 30 minutes back there to take family there for lunch. If they served dinner, I'd have to think about moving closer."
ETamajeJMUVK0kjqTlV8Ug,"Just paid my first visit to this place and I will definitely be back.  I tried the Southwest Chipotle Chicken Panini and my co-worker had the Hot Roast Beef Press.  Both were good choices, but seeing how happy she was with her choice I have to come back to try that one next.  Plenty of off-street parking.  I only wish this place was open on weekends (although given their location I can understand why they are not).  Maybe open a second location near the business park at University and Elwood (hint, hint)?  I'm pretty sure it would be a big hit."
zFXJ1g4xkD4-WLANb_7tkQ,"The Lunch Lounge is absolutely delicious and fresh! Everyone is always there with a smile on their faces serving up yummy sandwiches, wraps, and salads. I haven't had one thing on the menu that I have not enjoyed. It is the perfect mom n pop shop of a deli!"
jeONDYVsH6xxKd0K18yrlw,I got the southwest chipotle chicken panini and it was good but not great. It also cost $7.99+ tax which is too expensive for a sandwich with no sides or drinks. I would come here again if a friend wanted to eat here but i wont come back again on my own accord.
S22_jgLFNA8AQyGM5SusMg,Really good sandwich. I love having my lunch here. I usually buy Veggie Sandwich and I ask them to grill it. Tastes really good and affordable too.
43ngKD54LnCu_BUrNWy92w,"Hidden cafe with outside seating.  

Don't let the name fool you...they also serve breakfast. 

Great prices including my 1$ coffee!"
ow9-GQeZy9f8PnOa4KSnng,"Needed to find a quick easily accessible place for my kids and myself to eat and this place was in walking distance right behind Radisson hotel where we're staying at. Was able to find something for all of us. Pb&j's for the kids and a hot pastrami for me. Both were delicious and the staff was friendly. Quick, easy and much healthier than the fast food chains. Would of course recommended and return to the lunch lounge. Might actually get me some coffee there tomorrow morning."
LV_chTALhXSNHwkpgCybbw,"This place is located in a prime spot for travelers as well as office workers. 
The menu is a diverse and creative mix on standard lunch box fare. 
Whether it is breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with trying this place for a simple, but gourmet, breakfast sandwich or a dressed up salad for lunch. 
I only gave them four stars for this type of venue because I felt they were a bit understaffed when I arrived around 10am. Don't hold this against them. It was a bit of a wait for a sandwich but the quality is well worth the wait. The dill on the breakfast sandwich was a nice touch. 
The outdoor seating was nice on a cool morning."
h2jLfElXn9fcXTJXjajhQw,"Ashley is a great photographer! She took my maternity photos and newborn photos of my daughter. The pictures came out amazing, she did such a great job. She was so much fun to work with and made you feel comfortable. I would definitely recommend her to anyone needing a photographer and will continue to use her in the future. :)"
63e0TJE2W5BAgce_eVtbig,"Ashley shot our Christmas card and we had the best time with her, plus she's a complete professional! Our two dogs were there and she was so patient with them and also helpful when trying to get them to look at the camera. She came prepared, had different variations of props to best suit us and was truly a joy to work with. Since our shoot, we eloped and are now married but when we were shooting, I told her we had been engaged in April but never did an engagement shoot. After that, every single shot she took she made an effort to show off my ring! I am looking forward to working with Ashley again for our maternity and future family photo sessions! :) Thanks again for everything, Ashley!"
RO0XuRRqiVVjqz-SkO7P8A,"Ashley took newborn photos for my daughter. She was so detailed, warm & made it fun. Not to mention the pictures turned out beyond beautiful. I look at them often (years later) and tear up. Ashley really captured those moments you want to remember forever. We will absolutely be using her for future pictures."
0ae8xjqyulXFyRnVod1EoA,"Great photographer who took beautiful pictures of my grandchildren. Attention to detail is impeccable, customer service is outstanding and the cost is comparable."
QqXa7pnQYcyyUHI2uo1J9Q,"Much better! I frequent the Charlotte area for work. I previously tried the Golden Crust and honestly I was not impressed. I just went  back this past Saturday not for any cooked food but for prepackaged goods. I shared my dissatisfaction with the manager and she shared things have changed for the better.  A new cook has been hired and she offered samples of oxtail which was tender, well-seasoned and delicious. She also shared a hot flaky fried dumpling, YUM! I'm pleased that the management and cook has changed they are now representing Caribbean food well."
77vyq7BxQ9QBRdys1W_aDg,"What I had was good .. jerk chicken combo with rice and cabbage and gravy on top , and a patty .. very tasty, will stop back 3.6 to 4"
kPp5xyH5QMr8wxYz6ylNFw,I was SO excited to see Golden Krust outside NY so I had to stop in while in the shopping center.  My curry goat was SO delicious and had all the right flavor and spice.  The flavors reminded me of the great food I used to get when I lived near a Jamaican area in Brooklyn!
8eLLSpaJnzNF-wckRiQnQQ,"Prepare to be flexible because a lot of things run out.  The food is ok but I tried it because of the lunch specials. I wanted Mac and cheese they'd ran out. Ok, sucked that up because I prob didn't need it anyway. The vegetables and rice to me was very bland. The staff is not friendly and customer service is poor.  Don't come here with a lot of expectations."
bQH4t-oqo-5JUlTLq_pn1w,"I really enjoy Jamaican food and was excited to see a Golden Krust in Charlotte.  The food was average and I didn't get to try the items I really wanted or any patties. I came in at 11:15 and they told me that most of the menu wouldn't be out til noon.  

I may come back to try the patties."
abzG_1BqpTq0sR2Ol099AA,"I've been going to Golden Krust since the franchise came to Charlotte. Food is always great. The prices are reasonable. Service is just OK. On busy nights like Friday and Saturday they have run out of certain items.  I don't know how authentic the food is but it is on par with other Caribbean spots in town. Over all, I do recommend Gold Krust to get your Caribbean fix."
75wHJ12WyXoxmpQ6fFFlQQ,"Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! 
Now, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust......."
LydIJlouXND8lXDTzSBUyA,"No frills, just good Caribbean curry to go. Goat curry lunch special is under $8.00 with tax. And they have other specials daily while they last. This is a franchise so like all franchises there are certain guarantees in terms of food style and quality and ingredients, but there's also a sense of family here which doesn't exist in all offbeat chain restaurants."
XEdHAeMYhH5iF0kTA5Npuw,"Golden Krust is decent Caribbean for fairly cheap prices.  If you don't have high expectations for service or want to be ""wowed"" with food, you won't be too disappointed.

On both occasions, I've had the dinner combo ($8-$10).  The food itself is pretty good.  I had the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat, both of which were not too spicy. The plates are served with generous helpings of rice and red beans and another side, usually steamed cabbage or collards.  The meat portions was kinda slim.  But the service?  A total take-a-number-and-wait-for-me-to-move attitude pervades this place.  The line was long and the staff were slow to move.  Geez!

My buddy and I sat in the back dining hall, which they closed off with a wet floor sign as they were closing in an hour.  RUDE!  I had to walk around it to get a drink refill.  If you want cheap Caribbean food for takeout, this might be a OK place.  I'm sure that there is a Caribbean joint with more personable service and exceptional food."
JeQ7nexlSkcuq35CBIiG1w,I am so glad that they got one of these stores here in Charlotte North Carolina I have been trying to find it I found you found Golden Krust Bakery you must eat their the best you're making pulled ever wish they had more big location that is just a little too far for me to get but I get there when I can try it you will love it Golden Krust the best ever
SAzBU_Sx7Cfq7CGYptTMNw,"If I could give this place 6 stars or more, I DEFINITELY WOULD! I always recommend this place to everyone. Outside of the place doesn't due justice to what deliciousness is served inside!"
_yBv4ZtH7ifEeudNmbFyPQ,Food is just okay.. Their portion sizes for the amount you are paying is terrible.. You get more Styrofoam than food and I don't like paying $10 FOR Styrofoam. They need to give you a better value. If you are going to cut portions on the meats at least put a good portion of rice so you feel like you got something..  The ones in NEWYork are much better. imho
ZnIYRO5zXuW8eE4Qiqwovg,"Pretty good Caribbean Food, Nice location, and decent service. They use to be a lot better years ago. It's a little overpriced for the portions you get, but overall it's ok and I'll probably return"
ifGCxe9H9GmiA9_Yh8-wQg,Bland food. I don't even know how you can make jerk chicken bland but they managed. The customer service is mediocre. I just recommend going elsewhere.
Ub7ZiK9pfK4CVM3JFSAOHw,"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and always received pretty decent service. The food is always tasty and never really found that service was an issue until my last visit.
I had a Jamaican visitor and she want hard dough bread to go with our dinner. Now I could have gone a couple of different places but I chose the Bakery. I love this bread but I typically only eat it when in NY, Jamaica or Florida because I need my hard dough to be as fresh as possible. 
While the seemingly nice woman was ringing me up I politely asked ""how old is the bread?"" Now I know this is called a bakery but everyone knows their baked goods are shipped in. She responds by saying ""the bread is fresh."" I say your idea of fresh and mine maybe 2 different things. She became a maniac but in a calm way. She asks: do you want the bread or not? At the time I really just needed to get the bread and leave, dinner was waiting. But not before I explained that as a consumer and patron of this store I have a right to know how old something is in a darn bakery that doesn't bake anything.  
After the fact, i was very upset because I could have gone somewhere else, and for her think that it was OK to respond in that manner bothered me. Why was she so combative in the first place? In the end, she told me their shipments come every Tuesday. So this would be the best day to visit if you need baked goods. I myself, will never spend another nickel there."
RJOCu7omsWzeLGaw191eOQ,This place is NOT Caribbean food! It's terrible. You must ask for a drink separate from the combo even though you've ordered a combo. They're not going to offer it to you either. The food tastes horrible. I wish I could sit outside and turn people around to save their souls. But unfortunately this is all I can do. Take heed and go elsewhere!!!!!
IDAs8s_uBf2Ag7JfCzKdSA,The jerk sauce tastes like bbq sauce from a bottle mixed with ketchup! I should've known to keep walking when I didn't see any customers. Never again.
8xeVKHqYWyL7kc7GW6ot1A,"Golden Krust really does live up to the name. I ordered Jerk Chicken with a shrimp Jamaican patty. The Jamaican patty had such a crispy, well put together crust. It was probably the best Jamaican patty I've ever had. If you're in the Charlotte area & you like Caribbean food, it's definitely a spot to look into."
8qWThGPh_hFoUBLzonAKPA,"Love the veggie patties, when they are available...haven't really eaten anything else there."
ZoliATYd76iNDQM-R6mS1g,"The food here is really good, if you are in the mood for Jamaican food this restaurant is great. The sell cakes and patties which are very good. They get a four star because their portions could be better for the price."
7PUEJnGT_R9KjUC43uAckQ,"It has been awhile since I've been to Golden Krust and I remembered this place being pretty good but things have sadly changed. Walking into the restaurant it was extremely humid and hot so I assume the air condition was not working. My family and I proceeded to order since we were starving. We ordered the Curry chicken with rice and beans and cabbage, Oxtails with rice and beans and cabbage and Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage. We also added 2 spicy beef pattys, they did not have any more regular beef pattys, I was disappointed. With it being so hot in the restaurant I wanted a Large ice water BUT their fountain drink machine was not working and they did not have any bottle waters. The only drinks that were available were bottled juices that I was not interested in. So I walked over to Shane's to buy a large drink. After returning with my large drink in hand my family and I ate dinner. The curry chicken was my favorite out of all the entrees we ordered but I was disappointed in my plantains were very soggy and not fried long enough. The oxtails disappointed me the most. They were not seasoned and did not really have a taste. Overall my experience here was just ok, I hope Golden Krust improves the obvious issues and bring back the original Golden Krust."
mLpQ8o2UVydo5SIYPicYkg,"The roti here is an improvement on the other Jamaican restaurants I've eaten at in Charlotte. I'm from Brooklyn, so I'm used to having maximum food for a great price. Not so in Charlotte, for the minimal amount of oxtail, the price could be a bit lower. There is no reason to pay a high price for lots of rice and cabbage but a scoop of oxtail. 

I'm definitely not expecting oxtails to dominate the plate, but the serving my daughter had was enough to convince me I won't be getting anything other than beef patties here. That is, when they actually have any available."
qhN6T0i8Bcz77Gw0lZXrsQ,"Right off the bat, don't go to this place expecting warm and cheery service. Just focus on the food to keep your satisfaction levels in check.  I met some friends here after work based on their recommendation. When we got there, it was empty (this was around 5:30 on a Monday evening) but definitely picked up as time passed.

This was my first time eating Jamaican food (I know!) and I wasn't all that hungry so I hemmed and hawed over the menu for a little bit. I went with the spicy chicken Jamaican patty and a pineapple-flavored Jamaican soda. There's a case of bottled Jamaican sodas or cans of American sodas (coca-cola, pepsi, or mountain dew). FYI - they don't always have all of the patties listed on the menu available to order so just ask before you get too committed to a particular flavor. The woman went into the back and came right back out with my patty. Nice and warm, ready to eat.

I went into the back seating area while my friends finished placing their orders. The patty was a fluorescent yellow color which threw me off a little bit but when I bit into it, my fears were long forgotten. The patty crust was flaky and had a little bit of a sweet flavor that balanced the mild heat from the meat inside. The Jamaican soda was very sweet, which should come as no surprise since its second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. It's definitely not anything I would probably have again but it was good enough to wash down my patty. I got to taste a bit of my friends' meals and I really, really enjoyed the jerk chicken. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful. It's definitely some I would order on my next visit. Also, the coco bread was/is a winner.

Overall, a good spot to get your introduction to Jamaican food and/or to indulge your already long-held affection."
tfNlQpBAJgZepWO6IXhIxg,"This is a nice spot for some of your Caribbean needs.  You should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the University Area.

It's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  The menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  I have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the Goat Curry or the Oxtail meal.  I don't know about you, but when I ordered these, I also asked for extra gravy.  It was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. Note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  Kinda a bummer on that part. 

The place is alright, pretty small.  They have tables near the register, and also near the back.  I haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as I have only gotten take out.  The prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it."
WUJLbMGtLXenOauafm7BOw,"Was given three prices for The ox tail combination additionally they did not have any fountain drinks or ice had to pay an extra dollar for a canna Coke in addition to the meal that should have included a drink, according to the menu"
1ltFxd_dxJ55ZiEGtdhimw,"Food is good, price is good I can't take that away from them to be fair. However I ordered a combo that included a drink and Jamaican bread(forgive my ignorance). I paid with my debit card then when I got my food that's when the woman informed me their drink machine was down, and they were out of the Jamaican bread. Which she then immediately followed up with "" no refunds""."
C0QZoRpYdaWsU4ne5TUihQ,Delicious food!!! I have been coming to this Caribbean Restaurant since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago. I must admit there was a decline in the food quality about a year ago due to a change in chefs. I did stop coming during that time. I stopped in about a week ago to give it another try. I spoke to the owner and the pleasant staff and found out they have a new chef which they gave rave reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that the were indeed correct. I food was scrumptious  just as I remembered!! Keep up the good work!! I'll be back and I'm putting the word out.
f6snZFRJ2SadUP9Km7nnOw,"FOOD IS GREAT.  The service is average.  The prices are cheap so you tend to get idiots in there who have no manners.  I recommend, taking the food to go or sitting in the back."
-hAtmQFWrDePTOioOGAW3w,This food was not my favorite I spent about $12 and barely ate any of it. I went on my lunch and was driving and eating very disappointed. I may try this place one more time in hopes of better flavor.
TK-4DQpBNzvtfGSPskSQQA,"Tis De Place Mon!  First Off me Being from one of the best cities in the world. NYC i know good west indian food and this hit the nail on the head! Great to the point service, with hardy plates not for the quickly filled stomachs here! Try the cuury goat! and the beef patties!! and a DG Soda!   best in carribean food in charlotte, nc! This is truly the mirror image of true carribeen food! anything else is just a watered down xerox copy.  then even have the spice bread and pastries!  Best for lunch $5-6, and dinner $8-10."
df6kl4vRmARX0ydiQt4SeQ,"Ive been going here for yrs ...as a NYer I'm familiar with the chain. The foods good but I'm never going back. They've lost me and numerous family members. I wonder if they changed management or something because their portion sizing are horrendous! Theyve scaled back so much and still charge the same thing! I'm not paying for Styrofoam! Then if you ask for more rice you get told ""no!""  What kind of service is that?! I got a whole lot of gravy though! Ugh theyre rude too! Now the food Id rate a 4...maybe 3.5. But the service and portions a 1. Shame I stopped getting plates and stuck to beef patties but then they stopped serving cheese beef and never bothered to have them again or remove it from the menu. Ill be going to the other Caribbean restaurant up the street from now on."
3IZqYKXIG7qmPr1wgxeKKg,"Love this place for spicy patties! The patties are worthy of 6 stars, the only reason I gave the 4 stars is because every time I visit the music is blaring and the air conditioning seems to be turned off or not working. They have a dining area, but I can't imagine eating here. And be prepared for a wait, if you have been to the Islands then you know the slower pace you have to get used to. 

I have tried several of their curry dishes, the goat was my favorite. And if you're looking for a cold bottle of Ting or a piece of rock cake, this is your place. Did I mention the spicy patties? Wow, they are delicious. Growing up in Miami, we had a favorite place to go for patties. Here in Charlotte, this is our favorite place. I usually pick up 6, and I'm sure they would hold up fine for a couple of days in the fridge. They never last that long."
U38h1YLDdZZCEr5MbKLujw,If I could give this place 10 stars I would !!! I loved the food and the service was VERY FAST ! I loved everything and the small plate filled me up I couldn't even finish. The prices are GREAT and it's seasoned so amazing! I felt like I was on the islands. I would go back and take everyone in my family if I could I will definitely be returning my next trip to North Carolina. I loved it !
BLIJFaJZ-_fOcBs16fL_6g,"Loved, Loved, Loved. It is a simple place, but you dont come to this place for the decor. You come for the damn good food. 

Please note* I am just a customer. There is no dicount for posting nor any compensation for this rating."
VuKbGklNbOESJSx76_EjyA,Is a small restaurant food is good! Also the owners are very friendly they make sure u are satisfied!
HBaAmcS9zp5rY1qiMuWygA,Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Meat is super soft and very tasty. Fried fish is delicious. Salsa is so yummy! Very friendly service.
41ORR2OPi2CP0FAoiWjwWA,"I  would've like to take a before picture when it looked all nice and pretty, but it was so delicious I just couldn't wait. I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed"
Oxz26pqpIb7dDVeuUzNZlg,"We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign. 

I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.

Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor. 

Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred. 

Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back."
JGIVj26nGtLgzsL4zeaP2Q,One of the few times I have given a business five stars. This restaurant has very good food everything on the menu is fresh and very very tasty. I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed.
w3ezGmzYbucBCNB66ilE4Q,"Las Vegas does not have a lot of good Mexican food unfortunately. So, when we do find one, it's always pretty exciting. This place was good. Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality. 
Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon."
wM9a-pB0MSnyIJ4eMmXBUw,"Trying to curb my taco cravings, checked yelp for a taco spot not too far from the house, when I came across the review for Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and they have a perfect 5star rating. I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food"
fEpol5iWEiqKdbrIuHOc3A,My daughter and I stopped in yesterday and truly enjoyed our meal. So much so we added an order to go. Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure.
rqCifVSFO9vNV9S97NoQng,"The carnitas sopés are the best! Carne Asada tacos are in second place... 
I eat there at least twice a week, and it's fantastic every time!"
XgoMPW26QuJ6duS08QXc-g,"Talk about authentic Mexican food!! there i was in search of a new place to eat close to work. I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.
      First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much. 
    As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again."
AL3myD9GD5Zj7YuVLq0N1w,"I stop by here on my way to ed fountain park when my son has soccer games.  I usually get tacos and tamales for the team and they love them more than pepes.
Definitely a go to place for great Mexican food...cant wait to try other items."
6EYXqTZHxfoZgA4gIrDVrQ,Very clean and friendly service. I had the Carne asada torta and my friend had tacos overall fairly good.  For a quick bite not bad.
0dP8Woa5xr1eNJ4eJlojlw,"I was surprised it was this good it was like a home cooked meal... I purchased one posole, 3 carne asada tacos, 5 fried fish tacos, a combination of carnitas, 1 chicken nugget plate, 2 orchatas and my total was $51 not bad at all."
sG2U7rH5NSTYR3-DumVT7w,"TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card payment

I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot. 

Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele. 

I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews. 

While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest. 

My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon."
Eb3mICEEu0E8obitUjI8sA,Their food is delicious!!! I got Huevos Rancheros and my bf got menudo. He loved it! The lady at the register was friendly and super nice! The coffee is really good too!!
jM1RJRrF4OUU0OyZSTgFeg,Great tacos de carne asada.  I really liked the salsa.  I added rice and bean and I am glad I did.  Delicious and very affordable.
LbwHTp9GEKk5xoQzIjITeg,"Wonderful divey taco shop with awesome Mexican food. Highly recommend the tacos dorados, cheese enchiladas and chips with the salsa bar. The flavors are amazing! They must do most of their business as take out since it is so small, but the eating area is clean and nice. Don't be swayed by the strip mall. Definitely worth a stop."
PM5aFLiwbKWDm_AtC71-3Q,"I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place.  I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.

I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty."
SxPbDeghypuf3ESF3CzXQw,"THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN. 
Do not sleep on this spot, if you are ever in Vegas definitely stop by... I cant think of my favorite dish because you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; The menudo The cocteles, The enchiladas. Mm everything is bomb! and always great customer service and very clean nice little shop. Love it."

6SaVHkF1qwexY-nbGaxlPg,"Craving for authentic Mexican Food and feeling adventurous and out of your comfort zone. Gotta try this humble and family operated place. Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican food

The cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too. 

When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!"
FiNxxZQA_b6HEuTumHaEag,"Man this place is bomb dot com - 
Let me tell you when it comes to Mexican good I'm picky  there's so many spots here in vegas so when something really catches your taste buds then you know lol"
7NzfZCe-pdsY0oMJr17MZw,We were in Vegas for a few days and after eating at a number of the expensive resort offerings we found this little diamond in the rough. This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now.  Go!
D26ZjupzxrjQHEt-wtCN7w,"Yes its definitely a five star hidden gem. A great pit stop on the way to Moab. Everything was fresh right down to the rice. A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back."
Y5kb-t6_mRVHnr2Yv778ig,"I ordered carne asada, fish, & chicken tacos. Tacos are really small & over cooked. Was really disappointed, expected a lot based on the reviews I read. You're better off going to a taco truck. I really hate how over priced tacos are now. Wouldn't mind paying $2-3, but at least give me what I'm paying for."
onvMwlNZZjZ4mIz_2z7kvA,"MI Pueblo is the BEST TACO SHOP IN VEGAS.
The owners are so sweet and kind. Their food is absolutely delicious. I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL. 
YOU WONT FIND MANY CLOSE TO HOME, DOWN TO EARTH AND DELICIOUS PLACES LIKE THIS."

Not only was it delicious, the lady taking orders was super sweet and a really good salesperson.  I was debating on getting carne asada fries because i had already had fast food that day.  Here's how the convo went:

Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day?  
Me: well, no...
Her: then they're not so bad then
Me: good point

Salsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot.  Yum."

LVRBgIK3CP5Ap__LlczgRg,"This place is special. All their food is made with the care you would expect at a family gathering. The hospitality is incredible. This is NOT your typical Mexican turn-and-burn kind of place. Every dish I've ordered thus far has been absolutely fantastic...Well assembled and delicious. Personally, I love the ""caldo de pollo"" (chicken soup). I could eat it every day! This establishment is a definite winner in my book!!"
4UPAFxc0r-KrJ20p4LOrRA,"Best fish tacos! I also like the Carne Asada fries. The first time I had a chicken chile verde burrito.  But once I tried the fish tacos, I was hooked! The other burritos are good, too. My husband loves the pickled/peppered veggies. He gets a bagful and eats them while we wait. Family owned and operated. Friendly, cheerful staff."

qbkhfoOAP43YREAH2t-PTQ,"I really liked the 'mom and pop' feel of this little Mexican restaurant, and the quality of the food was really good. Solid four stars. The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum.
My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to.
I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco!
My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!

So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark......."
bepPxZRTYhy4jWfWu_eCHg,This place is great! The food is amazing. Had a plate of chilaquiles and my wife had the machaca. The portions were generous and tasty. I highly recommend this place if you you in the area and want great Authentic Mexican Food!
K9RjHW__5WqYMZDdkFsneA,"Outstanding. Visiting Las Vegas and happened upon this place. Having been raised in San Antonio, I feel like I know great Mexican food. And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge!  The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them. When I'm back in vegas again, a meal here will be on my itinerary."

yVBbxIdDi5L1wf8BXQ9JZg,"The Spirit of Hockey is technically the gift-shop for the Hockey Hall of Fame but you can still enter from the main entrance even if you don't want to go through the museum (even though you definitely should!)

This store is pretty much exactly as you'd expect: wall-to-wall memorabilia of all your favourite NHL teams. While I was mystified at first, it quickly wore off. It kind of became of game of laughing at all the ridiculous things you can stick a logo on (would you like some novelty cups to go with your keychain??) 

However, the fact of the matter is that people do buy them so obviously there is a market for these things. I actually saw someone at the airport on his way out of Toronto carrying a giant Washington Capitals ""Man Cave"" sign that they had purchased at the store. I didn't exactly walk out empty-handed either (because who doesn't need a Harvey the Hound figure to sit on their desk??)

All of that being said, the store is well laid out and staffed by friendly, helpful employees, all of whom are enthusiastic to talk about hockey (or at least good at faking it!)"
fRGJjeWSbQfCZ8TDWasqLA,"It is not really fair for me to write a review of The Spirit of Hockey. I do enjoy watching hockey.. but really not into buying any memorabilia or some cheap overpriced keepsake just because there is a NHL's team logo on it. 

Anyway, if you have a friend that into that... and he/she might enjoy something from here... 

But if you are from out of town hockey fan visiting, you will be really impressed to see all these hockey related merchandise all under one roof! 

Now go spend your money!! :)"
PQRUQUvK3uydkkeNL5pnow,"Ich fand es sehr schön
Gute kostüme
Gute Besetzung 
Ein bisschen hat beim Bühnenbild gefehlt im Vergleich zu König der Löwen aber die haben ja auch ihr eigenes festes Theater 
Tolle Musik
Tolle Stimmung"
vD6cSUQR_iiJ2ju8o89WgQ,"Mir ht das Musica sehr gut gefallen. In den vorderen Reihen tanzte der Affe...soll heißen die Darsteller bewegten sich auch im Publikum. Beeindruckend auch, wie sie durch den Zuschauerraum schwingen. Es ist ein Musical von dem ich behaupten möchte hat sich gelohnt dafür nach Stuttgart zu fahren. Auch die Plätze im Theater sind gut ausgerichtet, so dass man auch in den hinteren Reihen gut sehen kann."

Thali was good along with mini tiffin 
Pretty busy on weekends 
Don't forget to try the coffee ( served in traditional stainless steel utensils)
Washroom pretty clean"
hmHpfSZfXTuNi0vsReTq8w,"We went during Thanksgiving weekend and realized they only had a buffet for $14-15/person. 

The dosas were brought fresh to your table. Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking ""washed urad dhal"" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love). 

Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay. 

Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle. 
I liked the hoppers dish."
GOUoPL6Y_aicIvoP4B3aEQ,"The food was quite good but the service could be better. We went there 1/2 hour before closing and were rushed to order and our food wasn't even hot. They wouldn't provide refills to the ""sambhar & chutney"" as the kitchen was closed!!"
pshC96Vt8phDg335MR6uxQ,I used to love their ala carte menu...now they have all day buffet very bad and stale food.....avoid at any cost....we can't even order ala carte. ....
z1IPBvG4czEcwzVYYRXgGw,"I'm really not sure why this place gets such bad reviews - maybe the quality of the food has gone down over the years, or maybe people are comparing it to some of the more fancy/expensive dosa places in the area. 

 I thought the Chana Bhatura & the Dosa that I ordered were delicious and I'm a complete sucker for Sambar. For the price and the quick service, I thought it was a great alternative to some of the other choices in the area."
Xn4pIF9paC7QjZrR3oVdCQ,"I have been to the Scarborough location and had a decent experience. I took my family here (12 people) after calling ahead and being ensured that there would be minimum wait time. When we reached here the line was out of the door but we were told it wouldn't take long. 
After 45 mins(!!!) of waiting we finally got a place to sit. We were happily looking forward to some tasty masala dosas. Well that's the first thing your order at a Dosa place right? Well guess what, they ran out of potatoes.... You can have a palak paneer dosa sir, our server said. Well I didn't come here and wait 45 mins to eat a palak paneer dosa. We walked and instead of having a nice time at dinner, we ate greasy Domino's pizza instead.
 Interestingly upon further investigation, I discovered some older reviews with the same experience. I wish I had read them before. At this point I don't want to set foot in at least this location of Saravana Bhavan. I might consider giving the Scarborough location another shot. With so many options around, please do yourself a favor and go to some other South Indian place in Mississauga where they don't run out of potatoes...."
O-DBxzWowHr1vi5LuB_x6A,"I am a big Saravana Bhavan fan. Back home in India as well as here. new to Mississauga. food is good. enjoy the buffet specially. Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too. 
samabr vada is another favourite. 
I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there. 
I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology. 
well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing.

cHA14ugNdhBISxWIKw_HSg,"EDIT:

I tried this place again almost after 2 years and it seems to have improved quite a bit. Possibly because of the new management. The food is much better now and we visit this place a couple of times a month and are pleasantly surprised with the changes. 

2014 Review:

I'm really disappointed with the degrading quality of food and service at this place. I'm not a fan of this place, but decided to give it another chance as my friend wanted to eat here.

The place has been upgraded, which is about the only good thing with this restaurant. The new management is pathetic and the food equally worse. We went in on a Monday night for dinner and the waitress took our order and took close to half and hour to get our appetizer. The vada was spoilt and when we mentioned it to her, she just ran away and came back after a while to say that ""This is how it is"" !!! and she did not even apologize. How Rude!!!! She seemed to have a lengthy discussion in the Kitchen and another waitress came to our table and served our food almost 40 minutes later. She did however apologize for the delay. Much better than our previous waitress. We were appalled at the quality of service here and vowed never to come back here again and recommend people from going here ever.

If you'd like to get good South Indian food in Mississauga, goto either Udupi Madras Cafe or Chutney Swamy or Guru Lakshmi."
ckevdpWvkhPiIlXN3609Ug,"Been in to eat and also have picked up takeout. Great menu, fair prices. Food was solid. I will return."
th_T0lKPrYCt6lcIECM-vA,"Terrible service - they can't handle pressure
Food served cold. Sambar that's key to a South Indian Dosa meal must always be served hot but was served cold. Their excuse for cold sambar was that they're just preparing it because of the rush. Shouldn't that mean the sambar should be hot?!?  And their servings for sambar are too small. They skimp on the chutneys. 

We'd ordered a Kara dosa which they got wrong. Not authentic at all. 

Hot coffee served cold. And when we asked for it to be brought back and served hot we got a lame excuse that the milk was just poured fresh, what fresh from the fridge?!?  When they did take the coffee back, it never was served again. And we still got billed for it. We asked for water several times.  Not served!!!  They finally brought out a jug of water as we were putting on our jackets to leave.  

This is the 3rd time in as many months that I've made the mistake of coming here. But no more.  

This place sadly does not have its act together and gets a big fat zero in both the food and service department. One of the staff even have the excuse that cold food is a 'kitchen problem'. Hello, is management listening.  

With this sort of customer service I seriously wonder why the place is busy or popular. If I could I would give them negative marks. One things for sure., they've lost an avid foodie customer."
COoskhNoQrbjpcxCh5BdYA,"This place has lost my vote completely .... Used to be an awesome South Indian buffet for breakfast with hot kaapi served with idli dosa and wada and a background music of suprabhatam to augment your weekend into a bliss... But off late the service is unbearable... I used to go as the food was atleast better than the others... Today the food also was a huge let down! Sambhar with no sambhar aroma just daal with tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds and idli, dosa, wada all undercooked and stone like texture and not to mention cold ..... And a background music of titanic? Really? This has to be a management issue.. Even the rava upma was disastrous ... The table was not even served water! 
I would just like to add is this restaurant was special to me and I used to come here very often... This is a yelp alert to other people to avoid this place and not to get their heart broken like me! 

If you are still thinking to try this place let me tell you they don't have gulab jun the only star entry of this place and have some cheap kesari... 
Thank you for not going and trying out Cora's adjacent to this shit"
1eZJbt6Y7b54CGli3YeW7A,Absolutely love the food! Brought many people here for lunch and dinner and they also love the food. I highly recommend masala dosa and gun powder idlys.
OTgGe54jpKgIJ0e0wzUGHA,"Had heard so much about Saravanna Bhavan- we just moved here from California and was excited to give this place a try. The service was non-existant...it was as if they were doing us a favour by serving us lunch. The supposedly spicy 'kara' dosa was tasteless and the potato stuffing inside was a violent red colour- using red food colour does not make anything spicy people!
My friend ordered another dosa which was so greasy that it had no taste but stale oil.
The thali looked OK but tasted zilch. The little bowls that the sambar came in...that was a mystery...some of them were stuck inside the other- probably the dishwasher could not get them separated- so basically that meant that the lower one was dirty. When we complained the server mumbled something and then never showed his face. 
Never going back here again"
zB-uYinco4c9u14GtYBn3Q,How many of you are aware that you get charged 10% gratuity on your bill plus 13% HST on the tip amount?  I am not aware that this automatic gratuity mentioned in the menu card. Can someone advise  if this is legal?  Anyway I think it is a dishonest practice. I am really disappointed.
Lc7GzIzD7n06dfyqvihKRg,"So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). 
So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. 

Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again:

1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! 

2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)

3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. 

4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? 

5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) 

6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. 

Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.

Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again."
cW9XQINtwasnXh3FoZk-mg,"#SOUTHINDIANFOOD #SARAVANAABHAVAN #YELPGTA

I've been to Saravanaa Bhavan multiple times, a couple of years ago. It never was my ""go to"" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick. 

My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli. 

It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular. 

Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time."
iI4MCm3h1CBH4mIm9mDRnA,"Dosa is sometimes seen as a delicacy. Most do not make this at home. So when looking for a dosa fix, and a proper one, I have tried to come here.

I came here about 3 times this year.

The service is minimal. You get your food, which comes in small portions, and you get out. You pay at the counter at the front. So that kind of tells you what type of set up this is.

Zero ambiance. hard cold seats, storefront setting, in a plaza. Walls peeling. 

It is all veg food - no meat. 

The dosa was barely filled. I mean, barely. I would say two tablespoons of filling in the large paper dosa.

I would rather go to Annjapar a bit further south."
_AQBiBk4NGuFS5MuIoyGfg,This Saravanaa is not as well run as the one in Scarborough. The food is not that good. The dosa was cold & okay. The sambar tasted like spicy north Indian dal! I am surprised since I was under the impression that this Saravanaa in Mississauga will be better than the one in Scarborough.
62rQaTXb0XMo3D8FfVbJBw,"Three stars for the absolutely amazing delicious food. They lose two stars from me because their service is HORRIBLE. Not only are they EXTREMELY slow, they don't actually care about it. They forgot half of our meal about 20 minutes after the first part was brought to the table they ""remembered"" one dish was completely forgotten about, had to ask (the girl who was sitting on her phone in the corner) to please it to us. We couldn't even get them to bring the bill after asking twice. 

If you don't mind waiting or being ignored. At least the food is very good."
ULFWaUwYi7PftxKIKIGu8g,"Ultimate south indian breakfast buffet! Totally satisfied with this place. The staff is friendly,the food is fresh, Dosas are crisp, chutneys are delicious and sambar is to die for! If you're planning to catch up the weekend buffet and don't want to wait then be there by 10.30 a.m."
vP8swFbBl9WEPUXgWAFM_g,Good value for food however I have always had an issue with their cleanliness. Overall not super clean but ok. Food quality is ok. Overall value 5/10
TkaQjEzPUfCNUqGDKxeIBQ,again - as usual - it's amazing!!
xp63FhRxJYXL20WRvt3DJQ,"It seems that a lot of reviewers have already shared their strong feelings on the flavor (or the lack thereof) of Saravanaa Bhavan. To be honest, it's not terrible like some of the reviews would have you believe. But it's not particularly amazing either. Maybe if we had ordered from the menu, it would have been better, but we opted for the buffet option, and it was all... one-note... Not bad. Just not mind-blowing. It was food stuffs that helped fill our bellies before we left town. It's closer to a [*][*] experience in that ""I've experienced better"" but a lot of the [*] reviews are unnecessarily harsh. 

I didn't touch the sambar. Sambar is one of those things that varies quite a bit even between two people from the same part of India. Personal experience has taught me that ingesting sambar (especially sambar that you've never had before) before a long road trip (or in my case, a long road trip and then a long plane trip) is asking for trouble and shaky leg syndrome."
iktzgZrYTmQceUqHLUOZNQ,"5 stars if you eat at a saravana bhavan in Chennai,India, but not here. They are not able to create the same magic here."
frDZjONa7ubQhGmP2YzSTw,Excellent for vegetarians and healthy food. Variety of dishes. If you want taste something different this is the place to go.
0ra9e8IxU5kJlwxih-soqA,On the name of Chennai's Saravana Bhawan we visited here three to four times but not good as other branches are. Last time visited Delhi's Saravana Bhawan and it was really good. We can't even compare this Saravana to Delhi's Saravana. I didn't liked there sambar and dosa was not crispy at all even filter coffee was like Tim Hortons! Also the thali is limited... Can you imagine?!? For the first time I experienced this kind of thing... We just needed 1 extra poori and for that only we had to pay. We visited Bahrain's Saravana also... Even that branch is also far better than this one!
OVZ-TCbfh7fSu0vKVLZRrw,"I would like to update my review on this place based on my experiences since.
I decided to try something different other than the usual thali. So I tried their Kara dosa, which came out to be a thick, soggy dosa with a sweet tomatoey sauce. Then when I visited again I decided to give their dosa's another shot and opted for their Mysore masala dosa, which I have loved in other restaurants. They warned me that this dosa is supposed to be spicy but I can handle heat so I was fine with that. But again, I ended up getting a overly thick dosa that was too soggy and tasteless. My brother got the chole bhatura, which he enjoyed but complained that the bhatura's were a bit too oily. 
So I feel that ordering something other than the dosa would be your best bet because their dosa's are just not worth it and you can get much better ones at Guru Lukshmi or Udupi."
l7WiMOZPfP6UZhn_obnLCQ,"Been here a couple of times and it was ok for most part. Not spectacular. The food has been ok, but we've always had good service. Returned last week with baby in tow, only to find no changing table in bathroom of this ""family"" friendly restaurant. Not returning."
X-caW4AMdMOBpDvqwGgiSg,"For my money, Saravana Bhavan is just perfect. food for a great price.  Crispy, smooth dosas and bubbly, chewy uttapam.  The Sambar is just like Dosa in SF, packed full of leaves, seeds, and spices that hit your taste buds in all the right places! 
The staff are super nice and kept making sure we were satisfied. ""More sambar, More Chutney?"" 
Yes, please! 
After getting way more than 2 people could eat (come in groups) we packed it up and of course left with more sambar and more chutney.  
Sat and Sun, the buffet offers all the south indian food you could eat, (AYCE) and desserts. Try just a bite of these super sugary, fried desserts and think about jogging back to downtown TO."
SmFAqExw0wY1itq8hqIwyQ,"Been to this location thrice at different times. The service has been pretty consistent - quick and efficient. I will not expect more from an Indian restaurant.

The food has been really good for the most part. Here are the things we've tried - 
The vada sambar is top-class; fresh, hot, soft and super tasty.
The bisibele bath is good with plenty of good flavour. The onion rava masala dosa is crisp and filling - the best I've had. One star off for the rava idli that lacked life... Otherwise you cannot go wrong with anything here!"
A3ndd6Za9IwGl-e4WpqE9A,"This is going to be a biased review because this chain is from my home city in South India. 

Now that's out of the way, this is the best place to get authentic south indian food. If you are a newbie to the cuisine go on Sunday for the buffet when you can try a bit of everything 

If you familiar with South Indian food, the mini Idlis, paper masala and the adai aviyal are something that you can always bet will be great. 

It's a completely vegetarian joint, so meat eaters might be tad disappointed - the flavour will make up for it, trust me ;) 

Enjoy."
jBpGidedpQRcQsbE-aHfZg,The idlis are so good! The service is wonderful. Rava kesari is the best. Cheese Kara Masala Dosa is also a must try. The quality of food and the speed at which its served is amazing.
XKmM3gy7DTUkaKsN6tIs2Q,"This place is always busy. We went for family day lunch. We waited for 10 mins after which we were shown our way to a table. After siting for 15mins (and waiting for the menu)  we were ""informed"" that they only have all day buffet that day. 

The dosas were served fresh and piping hot and aloo masala was a favourite at our table. The rest of the food was average; uttapa, Idli and medu vadas were all cold. For dessert they had gulab jamun (avoidable) and rava kesari (yum). 

In all a good place for South Indian food. The dosa and the rava kesari are a must have."
bmQ2jcgCKNryYtcczKe_1A,"I really love this place. The paper dosa is so crispy! The potato masala is very mild and the chutneys have varying degrees of spicyness. We also love their Rava Kichadi, Parotta's with potatoes and a delicious cauliflower dish. The Mini Tiffin is a great place to start and try a bit of everything. And don't forget to have some Rasmalai for dessert!  Enchanting!  The Rava Kesari is also delicious."
Qoc_JCZgk9Sv94fpwq_bdA,"I love the manager here, he knows us for a very long time. I like their food. The servers change so often that we don't like it but still they are much better than a lot of other restaurants.  

Food - 4/5
Service - 4.5/5
Management - 5/5"
OLSuyCoeOLaOgSfHeXsBcQ,"I am a huge fan of Guru Lukshmi and they set a really high bar for dosa in GTA. Unfortunately, Saravanaa Bhavan was a big letdown. We went in pretty late on a sunday afternoon. The decor has been recently upgraded which gives the place a clean modern look although it is still based in a strip mall. 

Most tables around us were having the thali which should have given us some strong signals. 

We ordered the vada sambar but the quality of the sambar was not good. The vada was not crispy as well which let the whole dish down. 

The onion and chili utappam was the biggest disappointment. It was so thick and dry inside that after a few bites we just did not have the appetite to finish it. The chillies were huge and it was quite a task to remove them from the almost thick pizza crust like utappam. 

The saving grace was the onion rava dosa but they had stuffed pepper in it which was annoying since it was quite strong. The accompanying chutney portion is too small and they were not flavorful at all. 

I am never going back again! Go spend your money at Guru Lukshmi. I am surprised they are a global chain with such poor quality of south indian food."
cdpFy5i5V1cPWe4jFLuoWw,"Disappointed ! They don't seem to function to the level they built up their restaurants in Chennai.
They don't have a clue about the importance of ambience in a restaurant .
Sacha"
FovEkq4pj5U1uewA75Clvg,"This is the worst place to have South Indian food whatsoever. I am a South Indian myself and wanted to take one of my colleagues to try south indian food.

Initially I thought of Guru Lakshmi but then I decided this place as Guru Lakshmi tends to get way busy. I have tried Saravanaa Bhavan in Dubai and this place comes nowhere close to it.

I ordered dosa and madras coffee. The coffee came before the dosa. I requested the server to give the coffee a little later as it would get cold before the dosa would even arrive. But guess what, the server plainly refused. I didn't want to create a scene in front of my colleague. Finally the dosa arrived and guess what again, it had hair on it. Yes the dosa that I wanted my colleague who never tried south indian food in his life, was trying it for the first time and the dosa had HAIR on it !!!

At this point I was going to almost lose it. But I kept my calm and requested it to be changed and hoped that there would be no cockroach.

Totally ruined my experience and I'm sure my colleagues as well. 

Please folks go anywhere to try south indian food but not here. For the same price you will get better south indian cuisine with NO HAIR in it !"
oaCwkb91TzpaKIZEMv1o3Q,"I tired their Special Thali today ( only thali on the menu ) and it was fantastic, it was a gloomy day and it was just pefect, 14 items all veggie, it took about 10 minutes to get my order ready, that is kind of odd I would say as they were not busy all all when I entered, that being said it was worth it..the food you could just tell was fresh and clean.

They also renovated, the place looks way better than before, they added some booths as well . so if you are in the mood for some spicy south indian cusine, give this place a try.


Please note: If you are trying south indian food for the first time, it is pretty spicy :)

thanks for reading 

PS. the service is a bit  odd but not rude. so dont be surpised if you find your server to be a little odd :)"
ASe8Hk6voOIytmrxDlkJbw,"went there for dinner last night. Service was average. Food was horrible. Sambar and Chutney tasted bland. Dosa was tasteless.

Won't be visiting them soon."
5qIsq76JTyO3fmED2ujdew,"Saravanaa has gone on a steep downhill trajectory over the past few years in food quality and service. The only upgrade as of now is the restaurant itself. A few months ago it was very unattractive, almost cafeteria style, with hard seats like you would find in a food court. Kudos to them for getting a massive facelift. I wish I took pictures, but it looks lovely inside. They even have an electric fireplace (for some reason) in the tiny entrance. 

But ambiance aside, the food itself did not get a similar makeover. I will never again order a masala dosa from this place. There was a mere SMEAR of potato bhaji, a few tablespoons at most, in my dosa. The chutneys were pretty bland and also in small amounts. The best thing was the sambar, spicy and warming. The dosa itself was very oily.

My dad had the Saravanaa Special Meal, which consisted of ten TINY dishes (curries, chutneys, curd and a gulab jamun), rice, two papad and two pooris. As is the apparent custom here, the poories were miniscule. They were baby poories. I mean, how much are they saving really by cutting the quantity of their menu items? 

And it's not like this place isn't hopping. We got there at 7pm for dinner and already a queue had formed. This was the trend for the rest of the night, and people even crowded outside and left when they were told it would be a half an hour wait.

The waitstaff were pleasant enough, although our server tried to take away my plate before I had finished. They also left the front door open for a while, telling us ""the air conditioning was not working"". It is necessary to note that it was 10 degrees tonight, not a balmy summer at all. 

This restaurant is NOT good for groups. There are tables of 4, and they can put a few together if needed. But do not come in with a group of 15, like people did tonight, and assume you will get a table quickly. Check ahead of time if you can make reservations.

My mom had the best meal tonight, the Mini Tiffin. It came with uppama, mini idlis in sambar, a mini dosa (with probably the same amount of bhaji as my dosa!) and a sweet. The sweet sheera was delicious, with cashews and raisins. Sad I didn't go for that.

PROS:
- nice ambiance, comfortable booths
- delicious, spicy sambar

CONS: 
- oily dosas with virtually no filling
- crowded early, stays that way through dinner
- NOT good for groups (call ahead)
- hasty servers who do not consider the weather
- miniature food"
i447aU58uZJs-Df94sKeGQ,"Great Masala Dosa - the mustard seed flavour of the Masala is perfect. The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result.  I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much."
tLQ-BpRYz1HvoHPWhSVlTQ,"We usually go to Anjappar Chettinad one weekends when I have a strong craving for a South Indian breakfast. My review is going to be a mild comparison of the two. 
We decided to try Saravan Bhavan a few days ago as I like trying different options. 
The breakfast buffet on Sunday is from 10-12 and we had arrived at 11:10 to quite a line up. We were seated at 11:30. 
The first thing I noticed was that the dosas, idlis and vadas are much better than anjappar and are really well made. The sambhar and tomato chutney is delicious as well. 
One of the reasons I crave this breakfast is because I love Rava Kesari and Payasam. The rava kesari was quite tasteless and the payasam seemed to have been thickened with starch rather than reduced the way it should be. 
We asked for two coffees as we noticed that there were no beverages in the buffet area (In comparison, anjapar has coffee that you help yourself to) and they brought us two very small coffees that were quite good. We didn't know until it was time to pay the bill that each of the 150 ml coffees were $2.25 each adding $4.50 to the total. 
For two people with coffee the bill came to $29.90 plus tip. 

I have rated it two stars because of the overall experience - food, service and pricing. 

Final verdict: Liked- vadas, dosas, idly, sambhar and taste of the coffee
Disliked: Service, wait time, pricing, poor tasting deserts, overall experience. 

Won't return."
SKTpq87BB53yLy4o7xQr1A,Love the dosas here. The size of a dosa is smaller here but it is also cheaper. A great bang for your buck. Service is prompt and staff is friendly. The restaurant is usually packed and is also quite spacious
JBEv2_R-4aATxy9mmiKrNQ,"Somehow after we moved to Mississauga this Sarvana Bhawan was just a block from our new place so obviously we had to check it out.  Come from Madras (the birth place of this chain) I would say it's the same flavour and taste as back home.  

It doesn't mean that's it's a great place to eat out south Indian food around here.  There are better options for sure. But if you are looking for good old Sarvana Bhawan taste this one pretty much nails it bang on."
QbJiK8Zj9XLssurUafOWfQ,Best south indian food in Toronto. Everything freshly prepared and I am surprised at all the negative reviews posted by some members. The service was slow but maybe due to the large number of people.
VyOKSOtxe39K2CrwPRXHXg,"Awesome authentic food and well priced
Can be quite busy over the weekends
Service can be slow, but the food more than makes up for it"
pxK_sHN16OwRbe2LBPLfNw,New Management is crapy. Quality of food very low. Used to a big fan of this restaurant but will not recommend it to anybody. Please dont eat there.
K3HZb8rF07FpWDJFXGmu4g,"This place serves the pure vegetarian south Indian cuisine .. even though I am not a pure vegetarian, I do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when I am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so I guess I can go here once in a while ..
The ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and I hate sitting in this area. The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess.
Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for. Their spice level is pretty low."
gPHffHb7Pg_Erl_1dGkeQw,"The food here makes me forget that I'm not eating meat. I'm a carnavore and make few eceptions about not having some meat on my plate, but I have to say I don't even miss it when I eat here. My wife and I have only ever gone for the buffet. I eat my vada with sambar,  my dosa with rice and tomato chutney, and my puri with potato or rice. It tastes amazing and I've never left without being so full that I'm uncomfortable, which is a good thing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because they need to expand. It's always so busy that the service is close to chaos. But I'd much rather have great food and slow service than great service and terrible food. I recommend this place to any meat lover like myself to prove that the occasional meat free meal can be very enjoyable."
e3XMzPuzQa-okjIR4nGo7w,"This was THE SHITTIEST first-dosa-tasting of my life. I know it's impossible to rate my first-tasting of anything, but I'm pretty sure when you get a sour stomach and horrible shits after being at a restaurant - it was a horrible first experience. 

I really hope dosas don't actually taste like what they did here. The food item itself can't be that horrible or else no one would eat it, right? But you see, I'm traumatized to a point where I might not even consider re-evaluating what they taste like and just leave it at that. 

The service was shoddy. The drink prices (non-alcoholic) are shitty for the amount you get, which is close to nothing. The venue looks like a McDonald's in an airport food court. If this is what they think south India should be, then I recommend that Britain reoccupy. 

The only thing I'd recommend is the Madras coffee, to-go. That's the one thing they didn't manage to screw up royally.

And paying $30 for all this, that was the rotting cherry on top."
Icjrm_OvZnSJaGKujCEAtg,"The place for Dosa, in my books!
This place has always provided the crowds with some great vegetarian food as well as my favourite, dosas! I am not much of a vegetarian, but i would go here for Dosas as well as other tasty dishes. 
The service is good, not the best, but still good.
The place is clean, and has the sink to wash your hands, without going to the washrooms...a must for your seasoned foodie."
1PutBL8y8MTFFpyNEQzO2A,This is a poor version of this esteemed franchise. Sambhaar lacked any tamarind and looked and tasted like daal. Chutneys were also subpar. The dosa was strictly ok. The Scarborough branch is much better. Very disappointed.
dsb7RjU_QuzAvKkemfMaVA,"I love a good fixin' of dosa every now and then. When I do have it, I always go in with expectations (which I'm working on) of the dosa rice crepe itself having to be crispy, the potato filling has to be spicy and spread evenly inside the dosa crepe. 

Craving dosa, I went to Udupai first (one of my favorite dosa restaurants) but they were closed on a Tuesday for lunch! Hence, I ended up coming to Saravanaa Bhavan due to proximity & time crunch. I guess it was a good excuse to try it out. 

Here's what I found at Saravanna Bhavan: 

-Mom and I ordered 2 Spicy Kara Dosas. We found them to be rather soggy and oily 
-The potato filling was blood red in color, making me think they had added in a ton of food coloring 
-The dosa crepe was overly thick
-Chutney's were okay; however they really skimped on it. I also found that the chutneys were rather inconveniently served to the left into three portions of the thali (steel square plate)
-The sambar was okay; nothing special. For some odd reason unbeknownst to me, they had used 2 katoris (small steel bowls) which were stuck together to serve the sambar in 
-As for service, there was only one person serving when mom and I went here for lunch making service slow. 

Sure it was decently priced; but the quality of food and service was worth WAY LESS than the $8 we cashed out for each dosa. Unfortunately, food and price do not go hand-in-hand here."
Y2G4L0PGa-Pjtgq4p7rj7g,"I have been to Sarvana Bhavan a zillion times, okay probably not zillion but you get what I mean :) if you are a true south indian food loyalist you will like the food. It offers good south indian food without the bells and whistles like Chinese hakka Masala dosa or the likes!! The food is very true to its roots and the chutneys and curries are cooked in chennai - tamilian styles.  

The place recently was revamped and is more organized and looks much neater. The servers are polite and the food is delivered without a very long wait time. 

I ordered the thali and it was very very delicious !"
In9I9K6j_thJbDRvGr8p9A,"Loved the Delhi Sarvanna Bhavan so was here to give this place a try.. not sure if buffet time was worse time to try the food but my rating is for the buffet food.

Ambience: 4/5 (on any other day would have given 5/5, only issue it's a little small place to have a buffet)
Service: n/a since it was a buffet I wouldn't rate the service coz there were a lot of people and food delays were natural
Quality: 2.5/5 (food was average, not what I had expected and in comparison to what I have had)
Quantity:5/5(since it was buffet)
Overall, it was a 3/5 for me, deserts were too sweet food was cold. I will definitely give them a try but not on a buffet day"
pWd6pYD-NxHFimRJKS-HVg,"Average! They could do so much better. No exceptional flat ours. Poor is were way too small. Only redeeming feature was the pappadums. 
Service is attentive but we have had much better South Indian."
3lVfoZKsy1vgVyGshraC4A,"I went here to have authentic south Indian food, however I was very disappointed.
Also the quality of food is low compared to their Scarborough location.
If you are looking for authentic South Indian food, I would not recommend this place."
wN60MSvRif3ArcUX7wDkvw,"I love this place. The dosas are really good and portions are big. The place is very clean and service is the best I've had at an Indian restaurant. The waiters treat you like your at their home. Whenever I'm in town, I go here."
VbomFRiOsKp5NEwIpb1rUw,"Worth a 3.5 star rating. We tried  the Rasam soup, Masala Dosa and Tomato & Onion Utthappam. It was all quite flavourful, though I found the soup to be a little too spicy. The mango lassi was quite nice and cooling after the soup. It was fairly busy on a Saturday night, but tables come available quickly and service is quick.  The furniture is a strange mix of marble style tables and old library chairs.  The floor was a little messy with bits of food, but otherwise the restaurant was clean. It's an interesting place; we'll be back to try some other options."
K4yL9JmtDUDGQpiqdyihLA,"It's been a while since i have been to sarvana bhavan and boy had i been missing out. I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately. 
Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right. 
Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried. 
Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too."
bMJUUbfsRDLKdXWw-rSF2Q,"Overall:  Worth the trek to Mississauga.  Great value, great taste, great people. 

Room: Not fancy, spacious, clean

Service: Friendly, even avuncular (more materteral), everyone's an auntie, and frankly a bit concerned that i wanted a second coffee 

Menu: Thorough south indian menu, tough to decipher without guidance from someone who knows the cuisine

Presentation: Traditional south indian restaurant, paper dosas are intimidatingly big but that's why you get them 

Taste:  Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness.  

Value: There's a reason this place is packed with Indians.  Tastes good and cheap!"
b3IVizd6WsfctbMJpRbmEA,"Love the food.. We order thali last time, my god there was so much to eat.. Every bit of dish tastes heavenly.."
Jx0BjTJwT_5v3Nskm--oHg,"My mom took me here today. I've had random dosas here and there but am not much of an expert. Per my mom, the portions were excellent, the sauces/dips tasted good and were plentiful, and the dosa itself was very good. I thought it tasted quite yummy but spicy (my mom says that's the point!), and was fairly filling. Around $8 for a masala dosa, which like I said is a good sized meal.

Service was very prompt, and the lady serving us seemed pleasant. The restaurant was fairly full at lunchtime. You order at your table but pay at the counter."
t0va5YUHk53bR1KMaquL0g,"Came here last Saturday with my dad for some dosa.  We were pleasantly surprised with the texture of breads, dosa and the complex flavours of the bateta and chutneys.  The masala tea was also very good.

The channa could use a little bit of work though.

I'll be back."
ZNjx--MiMZHKjyBs_Qp0_g,Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe their service! Worst part is the management though. This isn't the first time this has happened looking at other reviews. If there was a way this would be getting a 0 star!!!
kP-zN7EuHdvuseLA8eySxA,Just had a great meal at the newly renovated restaurant. Dark wood and comfortable banquets. The food was excellent as always. Idli were fluffy and the vada were nice and crispy. The cauliflower gravy that comes with paratha was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant. The best South Indian in the GTA!
Tw4pg5YmhcFCLFJxR7MPlg,"Delicious inexpensive South Indian food. I had the cauliflower dosa, not often available. Accompanied by sambar and 3 chutneys it was delectably filling for only $8. The new renovation has made dining in very pleasant. If you're a fan of South Indian, don't miss it."
BAmsz_CslgqEVlNAM9QX3g,"Check your bill! The restaurant adds 10% gratuity without clear disclosure. I added a 20% tip on top. In effect, I paid 30+% for service. And, adding insult to injury, this happened to be at the weeekend brunch buffet with minimal table service. The non-disclosure is deceitful."
WvFo4yScWd6G1sziajK1ew,"Reasonably good food but again the downside with this place, just like most other Indian restaurants is the service. The servers are unsmiling but not as bad as in most other Indian places. Depending on the time of the day, be prepared to endure some heavily irritating and ill mannered crowd. The food is however quite delicious and very fresh. For this reason I will keep on going back."
SmZqUEQUmSt2pp-MBFIl_w,"Poor service. Watered down sambhar! Cold idly and poori!! I have been coming here for past 2 years. There was never once when I had received good service. The server working there seems like he hates his job. He's been working there for as long as I dined there.

The dosa is average. However! The idly and poori always arrives at our table cold. The poori is so hard that it's barely edible. 50 % of the times, you will get good sambhar. But 50 % of the times you will get sambhar that is watered down and looks like water too.

I really hope they improve their service and food. Don't serve the stale and hard poori to your customers!"
0ctYpkSOWxRYnnnA7N7akQ,"I will never return to this place! They made us wait for 20 minutes even though there were rows of empty tables. Then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and I had to ask to be served. We had a pretty simple order-2 people, 4 items. They managed to mess it up. Food took forever to come and one item was missing. When I asked for the item the wait staff denied I had ordered it-their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. The manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' Um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. What are you doing if you can't handle the customers? And to boot-they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill. 
The food was mediocre. Stay far far away from this place. I'm sure there are better places for a dosa craving."
c3cV08FgOBsD13MDrSNr-Q,"We went to this location during the dinner hour. The service was good and the servers are friendly. 

We ordered a dosa and I went with South Indian thali as its very different than Punjabi thali. The food was average and good for the price and quantity point of view. 

The only thing which threw away the stars was; while were eating the dosa, at the end we found a rubber band piece in the potato masala. I told the owner when I went to pay and he was very apologetic and stated we should have told him earlier and he would have made another one for us."
VYyGjHN0Z98K8szZ-JlG_Q,"I have been here thrice...not because I am a fan...but because this place serves decent south Indian food...
Fellow yelpers who have ever tried at their outlet in Connaught Place, New Delhi...will call it below average but you can't expect same standard everywhere! Can you?

Service Wise: It's slow and when the restaurant is busy...expect slower service. I went here on this Ugadi. It was packed and they forgot my order. Two gentlemen on my table finished their thali and I got my tomato uttapam when they were done. 

They have good servers...warm and soft spoken...but expect slow service!

Food: Decent/ Average/ OK..Thalis are ok...so it the idli/wada combo and Uttapams. Its not at all an expensive place

Ambiance: Please don't expect much"
j8f03XfX3AN8kXWJcdsI9A,We went here on Saturday evening and I wanted to order Kara dosa which they did not have. We ordered mix veg dosa and tomato onion uttapam and requested they make it in ghee which they refused.We had previously come here and they had made our dosas in ghee.The sambhar was cold and when we asked for another one that was cold too.Worst sarvanna bhavan in the world.I have been to Dubai and London locations which are much better than here and have more variety of dosas.
i35liAtJ6XY1LG7ARWtQig,"Went for Saturday dinner with 4 ppl.  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Extremely clean!!!  Love the hand washing station!!!  Great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons:  (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes.  We ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees.  One entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came.  It wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol.  This is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you :)"
06cpVHnUQP6Ewusn88TlmQ,"Consistent good quality, flavors and fast service. My favorite South Indian food option in GTA."
d8MUpsiXZaNJnxxNkR3Oig,"Tasty food , nice clean place . prices little bit high for dosas but similar to some others in the area. Try some of the specialty dosas."
xN20-TC9cunuQyzXlXraMw,"Great place if you want to taste real South Indian food. Great customer service. The food was tasty, specially their Special Meal with different curries and rice. So far I have had very experience with this place after several visits."
KuQaicmFpzBvGPvBQ0RbmA,"I've been to both the Scarborough and Mississauga locations and I prefer the Mississauga one because of cleanliness and also they have washroom and hand-washing area tucked away in the corner. 

This time I ordered the paper dosa, sweet lassi and the special madras coffee.  The dosa and lassi were great.  The coffee was awesome! I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked that fact that it wasn't strong (they can make it strong if you want it that way) and I asked for sugar on the side. It comes in a cute little stainless cup in a small bowl and it has a lot of froth on top.  All in all a tasty meal.  At the end (where the cashier sits) I had some of the saunf (fennel) with candy...its good for digestion and its nice to eat something sweet (and free) at the end of the meal."
ISh7m3FGLBFFsa_Iz-nOSQ,Saravana Bhawan has regained its touch after the last review though the Manager can certainly work on his attitude.
ZuPJ7IPijglLoVd3X7o_4w,Today I went to sarvana bhava with my family at scarborough location this is one of the worst sevice I got I went with my infant baby (I had requested a seat in corner for my baby but the waiter was very rude he was more interested in accommodating other guest though place was relatively empty) and the service was pathetic. waited half an hour for tandoori paratha after finishing fist one and which never cameI wont recommend this place for anyone
ksAP7oFm2Eemm2WMyiXuWA,It's inside the mall and the food is awesome! Probably the best authentic Chinese dinner you can have on Christmas Eve in North Carolina. Just don't peek in the kitchen. You're all good.
76dFFvKoMDtfqAsu8O9V7A,A diamond in the rough... I get off the highway just to grab lunch from here. Remind me of the authentic Chinese take outs in NYC
thIBUH_46y46e7jYtCR6Aw,"It helps to have someone understand the language while in the Hong Kong BBQ, but they do have english menus that you can use on the counter.  It is pretty cheap for some good food.  Just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as I survived my visit and I am sure you will yours.  Just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.

Personally I really liked the BBQ pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips; which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good."
WWF2O94KLFL18o_fYceOHg,"This is as authentic as you're going to get.

I'll be straight up when I say that places like this can make me nervous.  The mall itself is sketchy...and it's in a sketchy part of town.  I make it this way every few weeks for some bánh mì at Le's, but came on a day that Le's was closed.  Dim sum?...or the place with ducks hanging in the window?  We opted for the ducks in the window and chose Hong Kong BBQ.

When you enter Hong Kong BBQ...you can tell there's going to be a communication issue.  There is literally...not a single thing resembling ""American"" in this restaurant.  I knew I was going to like this place.  I did my best not to look back at the kitchen.  We all know what that is going to look like...and I'd rather play dumb.  Dangit!  I looked.

The service was quick and the food was great!  We were even entertained with Chinese soccer on their small TV.

I'd recommend coming here if you're an adventurous person...otherwise...you'll never make it as far as the door...much less the table."
DJJkwGxssiLmKH07Yal7iw,"Pretty run of the mill mom & pop shop, roast pork & bbq pork is sold at $9 a lb. and what can I say the bbq is pretty on par with what I can get in Boston both crispy and flavorful respectfully. Great to know I can find some comfort food in Charlotte."
lHg3sPq5hFNM7IJAaJY7Bw,"Missing Hong Kong BBQ... found this on Yelp and was excited to try it.

But, the BBQ pork was extremely dry... was disappointed. However, the service was good and they had the ginger/green onion sauce which is a plus as most places either wouldn't have it or would charge you extra for it."
uM10SUTEKhukjqSUDQDKAw,This is definitely a hole in the wall place. I was actually picking up banh mi sandwiches and saw this place. The duck and pork were prepared as well as the places I go to in ATL. I will definitely be stopping by this place again when I'm in the area.
ZNMpRGYdt1iwTcbVLxQyrA,"I took my 2011 Q5 in for a LOF (Lube, oil and filter). Went to pick up the car and was told it was $250 for the invoice, including a $72 charge to reset the service light which was not quoted. BTW this is like a 5 minute procedure that they charge you 30 minutes to do.

I'll never go back there. 

I went to Midtown Audi in Agincourt previously and had excellent service. I didn't go back there because it takes weeks to get an appointment. 

I was able to get into this dump the same day, now I know why!!!

Avoid this place!!!!!"
Skfeg43entc5irWFUUxIAA,"The worst service dept experience. The two people i dealt with  were defensive  dismissive and rude when posed simple questions. Especially on cost of items,In this case tires. There was a price difference of over two hundred dollars between tires and install between downtown and audi dealers north of city.  This was a second chance  for audi downtown for me because of a previous visit  that went bad and the manager called to apologize then and said give us a chance so we will make it right.  Sorry  i will never go there again."
vquJIlx8HUQ6h1pcOj_o0g,"If you need to buy a car, call Edit Omar! 
There are so many sales people out there that don't listen to what you want. And I'm in sales!
Edit took the time to go through all the features, specs and pricing. She even clued into the fact that it was me buying the car and handed me the keys for the test drive. (so many car salesmen just talk to the husband...hello, the car is for me..) 
She even stayed late so I could pick up my car the day it was ready.
** note - the next guy up the food chain will try and sell you the Audi Care Package. Worth getting, but as I said before  he was again speaking to the wrong purchaser, so I opted to buy it from Edit the next day.  ;)"
Lhg-16iCCBg8UFo1edjKpA,"They are quick to overcharge you and collect your money but crap on customer service. I would expect more from a dealership that represents such a great brand. Paid just over $1000 for my yearly service. They called me to ask if I could come back to collect some touch up pens. I refused to battle traffic so they sent it with their shuttle driver. My accountant needed the invoice for the original purchase of the car. Spoke with Chloe on a Monday who said she would send it via email. Waited one day-no invoice. After 4 phone calls with multiple messages,  I had to be insistent that something so simple be escalated to the attention of the manager. If they can't handle something so simple, I don't know how they handle the intricacies of fixing European car. Worries me a bit. I was also told that they would have to go onto their stock room to find invoice. That could've been communicated in a professional way well before the fourth phone call. Not respectful that people are busy. I would avoid and go to another dealership."
IK6yJyjLjfsVtsOn_oRupw,"After another problem with our Audi - this time a mal - function of the key in the ignition. I called and was told the battery for the key would need to be recharged a ten minute job I was told. As I drove in there were two service reps and 5 clients all waiting in line. So the ten minutes came and went and eventually the assistant manager asked me what the problem was I explained he checked the key and said they needed to order a part but the car was safe to drive.

Half an hour later my husband gets a call to say the part is in and they can fix the problem tomorrow. He calls back three times to eventually get someone live who insists there is no record of me going to the garage or of anyone calling my husband so ""We must be mistaken""!!!

Finally I have had it call back and ask for the service dept someone live and no v/mail - the girl on reception asks me over and over is it for an appointment or do they have my car in already. I reply neither - she asks the questions again this time no so politely I tell her to just put me through she then cuts me off.

So I call back and thank goodness get ""Sarah"" who I always dealt with until her mat leave. I tell her the problem she is gone for two seconds and comes back to tell me the car needs to be with them tomorrow as they have the part. 

So my recommendation is do not deal with any of the brainless reps there - deal with Sarah she is polite -super efficent and gets results...........................Still battling over wether we will get a courtesy car which is part of our lease agreement with Audi but they always seem to fail at!!"
tBSpYkCmay3_nPN6_VXWDg,"This place is horrible with the worst service ever!  The sales reps were very attentive when I came in to buy my car. After that, every time I came in for service was a nightmare. I made an appointment for service just this afternoon, and I came in at 2 pm, then I've been waiting for more than 2 hours for the service to be completed! I was told that they would arrange a shuttle service to get me home, and I've been sitting in the lobby waiting forever ! Then the last time I checked with them, they told me that where I live, which is Bloor and Dufferin, which is practically still downtown, is too far, so they can't drive me home,
but they can drop me off at a subway station. Then the guy promised me to drop me off at Young and Bloor, and told me their driver was outside and would be back in 5 mins, then I continued to wait, for another 45 mins until my car's ready, and I drove home. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service, because of that, I need to re-arrange my plans for the afternoon. The guy at the desk was like "" It's been crazy today. There's nothing we can do"". If you are considering getting an Audi, I strongly recommend you getting your car at other dealers. The service here was unacceptable. I also came in once because I noticed the drive's side mirror didn't change angles when I back up, and it supposed to. I had to explain it over and over again, but they failed to fix it for the first 2 times. Overall, I am so disappointed with the service, now that my warranty is expired, I don't think I'll ever come back."
194eVatIy18T33c3lJsqBg,"This Audi Downtown just opened a few weeks ago with a large showroom but horrible service.

I made an appointment for service last week and waited 30 minutes in line for the attendant to process the paper. Because they couldn't repair a tailight bulb last week, I had to return today to repair the matter. There were 2 customers ahead of me when I arrived at the appointed 9:30am, the same service personnel was handling matters. 

Get this: it took 35 minutes for the guy to serve these 2 customers and he wasn't even done (he was supposed to simply take their keys, note the issues, print an order sheet). He was wasting time chatting with one customer about the pros and cons of PC Windows when there are customers waiting. He didn't even acknowledge my existence or simply inform me to wait. Giving up, I placed my car keys on his desk and spoke with WIlliam Yip, the manager, who said he would handle it.

The facilities are nice but extremely short staffed and the guys at service do not know how to prioritise or customer service!"
MNJ8yC21RKzq0yivKUS0qQ,"Just bought a new A4 from Keif Grey. What a great atmosphere at the dealership, no pressure from Keif or Alexandra in finance and everyone else was very friendly also. Buying a car can be very intimidating and they took all that away. 
Robin the sales manager also helped make my decision easy. 
Would recommend them to anyone looking for a new or used Audi. 

Thank you."
o_X2PRC3KEkacuEK2QfHUg,"I liked the service when I purchased my car as sales rep was patient and knowledgable. I got a good deal on my car, and he even gave me winter mats. But when you're bringing your car in for maintenance or repairs, you won't get the same kind of service. Things rarely get fixed and you will be told everything is working as intended if you complain about abnormal behaviours. I once took my car in for alignment, and the car still didn't drive straight! Then I was told it's due to angle of the pavement. I can't wait to get ouf the lease and dump this dealer for good! I love audis, but I will take my business to Markham dealer."

n7B42YWassLuiZbQE9dmqQ,"This dealership has the worst serve department I have ever dealt with. Their service advisors are defensive, they avoid necessary repairs and don't listen to or follow-up on problems. I had so many issues I had to contact Audi Canada to get them to intervene. Finally I got the needed repair but when I went in for it I was faced with the same problems, lack of advisors so it delayed the process of registering the vehicle for service, and there was no apology for all of the delays.

This deanship continues to do damage to the Audi brand. I wonder if Audi Canada will ever step in."
vYqw4Ziwoo-i3yPEdrjh1w,"These guys are a disgrace.  Have no clue about customer service at all and treat people like garbage. Without getting into a long story I've had an issue with my brand new car that I just got in April that they insist is working.  Ignored me completely for the past 2 months.  Workday return my call.  They have now refused to even service my car there.  WOW! 
I wouldn't give them a cent of my money if I were you. I now have the media after them.  No one needs to buy a new car and go through all this b*******. Stay far away from this place. DISGUSTING!"
ewvgdvrcbeL3Fa8WsGmyZw,The food truck is a welcoming asset for a guest from out of town. The food truck is named fire*and*foraged and is amazing. The beer is also amazing. In my book this nanobrewery/food truck combo is definitely a double dividend!! The dark beers on nitro rock on the flavor profile!!
MJHDrzDFonNY-uo4llrK5Q,Just went here for lunch and it was really wonderful. We had the burger from Fire and Forage and the B.L.A.T.. Both REALLY good. Great atmosphere too
grSyB_07nUfjPWY4MiLDhg,First time in Phoenix and went to Shop Beer Co on recommendation.  Great outdoor space. Cooled by misters and comfortable even when outside temps are 100+.  Great craft beer that is all brewed in house.  Great food truck out back that rotates.  Come by and check out if in Phoenix area.
wDUu3Muo9sQx83DJ3VunuA,"The Shop has pretty good beer and I like the fact that they have a few guest brews too.  The outdoor area is great and having a food truck on hand is always a nice touch in case you imbibe a little too much.  

If you're looking for a day drinking spot, look no further.  This place is ideal."
mz7JG9yfkyP4uE577Dnkug,Great selections of beer. You can get a crowler there and the food is mighty fine. I'll be back.
QbgT1Fr1pM0UsU7xQO41AA,"First timer.  My wife heard about this place at the dentist in east Mesa this morning.  It's tucked away in Tempe off Rio Salado.  Great selection of craft beers, my first brew was The Nines.  Great Red Ale, very smooth even though it's IBU was 90.  My wife had the Coffee Brown Nitro which was awesome.  What a find after a root canal!"
gUxdeFC19U4NmbwRQzdurg,"This place is amazing. I tried the nines, coffee brown nitro, and (480) session pale ale. All are the perfect beer for whatever your feeling that night. 

I made the mistake of grabbing food before heading over, the food truck looked legit.

5 stars. You need to come here if you're in Tempe."
Okv5rF8EN0HlB9-bCHyRfQ,"First and foremost, I seriously love this place! 

First look:  
The whole place has a very cool, very inviting vibe.  The decor (industrial, rustic wood mixed with some seriously cool and unique art) hangout areas (sweet beer garden), lighting that makes everyone look pretty/handsome (with or without beer goggles) and a window looking into the brewery operation.  These features make it a really special place.  Even the restrooms are rad. It looks like a lot of love went into every detail.

The Beer:
This is a true tasting room.  I equate it to going to your favorite wine tasting room and enjoying the various types of wine, except it's delicious beer (obviously). (e.g.; the Nines, you gotta try the Nines!). What it is not is a pub or a sports bar with super loud people, Budweiser and NFL whistles blowing from 50 TV screens...which is refreshing.  I feel a person just starting to develop their beer palette would feel right at home bellying up to the bar along side a person with a honed, mature beer palette. It's a place to try and sample what suits your beerbuds best.  With tons of amazing beer options that have awesome names you know have a story behind them, you can't go wrong.  My husband tried the coffee brown ale and he loved it! Oh, and it looks like they offer special ""reserve"" and yummy flavored type brews each week as well.  Best to check out their Insta and Facebook pages for weekly beer offering updates.

The staff:
Great staff,  knowledgeable, welcoming, efficient and accommodating.  Eager to make you feel right at home.

The food:
I've eaten many burgers in my life, let me tell you.  Had the most delicious. burger. ever from the onsite food truck.  I think they are called, Fire and Forged.  Like the Shop, the food truck folks took great care to give me their best.  Quality beef cooked to medium rare perfection. Homemade pickles (homemade pickles people! Who does that!?!).  Real/non-iceberg lettuce.  Some seriously special sauce, too.  Paired wonderfully with the Nines! (See what I did there? )

Overall:
Great night out with the Mr. Even bought a couple super softy shirts and of course bought a few cans of the Nines to take home to CA.  Do yourself (and your mouth) a favor and get over to the Shop.  They are doing some seriously good work there.  Wish we had one back home..."
8ipnOsSFkoy3ReDZZP7GdA,Great beer and venue.  Like how the beertender was mellow despite some Tempe bartender douchebag telling him he needed to speak louder and with more authority.  The pale ale is surprisingly more hopped and higher IBU than the IPA.  I enjoyed IT.  They have a food truck out back and a huge patio so could be a great place to bring dogs as well.
UtUK0YiBdvBnrK1jtG_UZw,"The Shop is one of my go to jams for craft beers with a solid vibe. The staff is extremely knowledgeable/helpful and it shows in the beers they produce. They have a food truck in their patio area that has a constant presence; the chef consistently rotates the menu with all kinds of goodness that pairs fantastic with the brew. Must try beers when you go are Church Music & F.Y.I.T.M. ..... However, you can't go wrong in any selection you make. Might as well take a flight or two and experience for yourself. Cheers"
TtWrWtTWcNqGoaNgXpCJiQ,"This place gets an A+ for style and beer.  The ceiling of this building is beautiful!  The taproom is super comfortable and the patio is spacious and clean.  They have a permanent food truck that turns out burgers and other beer friendly food.  I had the hoppy red and the 480 pale ale.  I was very hoppy, I mean happy, with both."
lICj-pjW33k1bf9IddyH5w,"There a a few times in life when we find a beer so expertly crafted we want to linger and savor the time and wisdom of our experience. This is one of those moments. My personal favorite  ""The Nines"" is an Ale with balanced fresh caramel elements to complement its Red identity. 

The mellow yet vibrant atmosphere encourages your senses and stimulates your consciousness. 

Enjoy!"
hid1uBDuwYu4KY_qOWfVVA,"The Shop Beer Co is located in N Tempe not too far from ASU ...

It's a smaller cozy cool independently owned microbrewery that I didn't know ever existed.  One of the girls in the group had purchased a beer tasting deal off of Groupon and it was as an amazing price/deal!!! The amount of beer that comes with this deal is ridiculous - no joke!!

It's a nice looking establishment - very cool inside look... There is also a large back patio, a food truck, and then the bathrooms are located near the actual brewery area in a separate building. 

I am not a huge fan of alcohol, beer in particular, but I was open to tasting specialty micro brewed beers.  Some of the beers were awesome, some okay, some were hard to drink.  A place like this is for a true beer conoausor because they do offer a fair amount of diverse beers, but I don't know enough about beer, how it's made, ingredients, etc. to be overly critical about beer quality per say.  I would have to say that the darker beers here seemed smoother than the light/amber, and the beer made by/using coffee were the best tasting in my personal opinion.

When we first arrived the place was slammed - we could hardly find a place to sit down.  But oddly enough, the crowd died down very fast and by the time we finished our tasting around 7:30ish there was hardly anyone left in the place - it was dead for the most part, which seemed rather odd on a Friday evening.  The staff here was good - but no one was especially friendly or went out of there way service wise even when it got super slow....

The crowd seemed like college kids for the most part ... So it wasn't really our scene and I doubt I would go out of my way to come back here ... There is just too many other great spots to hang out in Tempe & Scottsdale.

This place earns a solid 3 start review because it was good/average ... overall there was nothing very good/exceptional or memorable about my experience here other than the fact that they offered a phenomenal groupon deal.  It's definitely worth checking out though, and I would recommend beer lovers to definitely come try it out!  If you are not a huge fan of alcohol or you don't like beer ... This is not the place for you because to my knowledge for the most part they only serve beer and water."
Zug--S8mlTW92CNT91gkpw,"Awesome Brewery! I stumbled across this place on it's opening day, at least the opening to the public, and even that's kind of an opening. Today was friends and family day, and special invited people, but if the public showed up but let them in and give them a free beer!
So, I showed up!... and who did I get to meet but Harry Mitchell, Kelli Butler, Dr. Eric Meyer, and a whole bunch of people who really love brewing craft beer. It was a great crowd, and excellent beer.
There were two food trucks, one served poutine made Southwestern style, and instead of french fries, they sliced up tamales, and served the gravy and chilies on the top of that! By the way, that food truck was run by a guy named Craig.
I had tried three of their beers the pale ale the IPA and the red and they were all excellent beers. I been to them before when they were cartel brewing and they were over in the old apartment building, and when they were in the coffee shop, but this venue is really nice and the the energy is palpable!
I definitely will come back here, even when there are no political celebrities!"
_AKSsEukv3SIf1j9TIdLbw,"Totally cool hangout! I found this place when I was out jogging around Tempe Town Lake. It's a quaint little house with a really cool patio. They have about six beers that they brew and another six to eight beers that they bring in. There's a food truck parked on site, I ordered the street tacos. 
I love the inside as much as the outside. There are plenty of tables, high tops, low tops and  bar seating.  This place has a cool vibe. Staff is friendly. They were more than happy to give samples of their brews with no charge. That, in my opinion, is good business.
I will definitely be back for another visit .....soon! 
Loved it!"
lLBWRlarmRQH-p7gcZttgg,"The Shop is THE BEST LOCAL INDEPENDENT BEER in the Phoenix Metro Area! Check them out... clean chill tasting room, incredible staff, and outstanding Fire & Forged food truck in the beer garden...
5 STARS oh and of course GREAT BEER!"
vojR4J1IiURJxmWhO9umOg,Really cool layout. The beer garden is a nice additional too. But the service was not great. The waitresses were sitting at tables. One was counting her tips and another was eating food and sitting with friends. The beers are alright. I wish the experience was better it's a cool atmosphere. Won't be back though.
a1Sl5gNjh18erik6uEg94A,"Great little patio, good beer, one of my first picks for a spot to hang out and relax, now I just need to figure out what to do with my kids so I can do that more often.

There is a food truck always on site, so it is really just a kitchen in a box, I don't know why they took that route but I assume it is a permit based decision.


The nitro stout I had was everything one would expect it to be."
AwIcZL3pydG0bfwjVXMm4A,"Live right down the block and am a regular here. Good beer selection with friendly service who continuously checked up on us. 
The food from the food truck served the basics: burgers, tacos, grilled cheese, but they're all well done and cheap. The times I come late from work, I walk over and have a great cheap meal with a pint. 
Love this place."
5ZUGhxnpswu-pfIVFnfWEw,"Husband and I stopped in around 4:00 on a Sunday to try a beer or two while visiting Phoenix. Two employees were inside, one of whom was talking/flirting with a patron at the only occupied table inside (one other table was occupied outside). Neither employee in any way acknowledged either of us. We reviewed the beer leaf for a minute or two, still with no acknowledgement from any of the staff, no hello, no invitation to find a seat etc. felt extremely pretentious, and not our scene. We left and were much happier and better-accommodated at Four Peaks."
k36_q9X86hEKJUoni-cd7A,"New to the neighborhood, and certainly a welcome addition. This place is worth taking the path off Mill. Great beer, staff and vibe. Do yourself a favor, and stop in savor the flavor. ""I just made that up"" :)"
zmdj0DzFsxgbTvwrIJNkow,Great new place to have a some tasty microbrewery beer. Super friendly staff. 4-6 of their own beers available.  Food trucks on site if you get the munchies. Coffee Brown Nitro was my favorite.
XD5aqEu6IAh6KUf17SF4dw,"The Shop Beer Co. knows what they are doing! I went here last weekend with some friends, and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was really great. There is a beer garden out back complete with a food truck and plenty of seating. I had their Sunset Daydream IPA & it was delicious! Very refreshing, summery with the right amount of hops. I will definitely be coming back, and would recommend this as a great spot to come with friends or to grab a quick beer after dinner!"
52rWpKW-G9P6xCUtlw3Yug,I checked this brewery out with a groupon for 4 people. Beer and service was great! The location is weird since it's in a residential area but the place itself was very cool! Indoor and outdoor and the weather was just perfect for outdoor seating. We didn't try the food truck but it smelled delicious. I will definitely be going again and I suggest y'all try it! Groupon has a sweet deal for this brewery
6hW9fM2ltACCBXs6mq0hsg,"Keepin' it simple & all about the beer! Love the vibe. No TVs, no sports games blaring. Just drink some beers and talk to your friends! They had a few different IPAs on tap, of course I tried them all. We had just ate dinner elsewhere, so we skipped the food truck, but will definitely be back to try!! They're just getting started, and I'm excited to see what's next for this new spot!"
FS8D8CHK3rufcKamoBT6Zw,"Had an awesome experience with my girlfriend over he weekend. The Church Music IPA and the ""Fight-Em"" DIPA were both ridiculously smooth. The food truck outside offered reasonable sandwiches to split and expedited service. I rate the whole experience as a 10 out of 10 and can't wait for my next trip back there. Additionally I purchased a t-shirt that fit perfectly and is quite comfortable."
xHJXpfSKsJqmhwMf9mdvTQ,"Always looking for new beers to try. Having ""the nines"". Great taste. Very friendly. Amazing atmosphere."
4S9bj9ZPFrxCA9vuCTbmQQ,Ambience was great - small beer tap confusion on the second pour but overall great experience
tY6HL6X_kIJU52oh9ImPYg,"Bring your beanie and your judgmental hipster attitude!  I wanted to love this place but we had such a bad first impression. My boyfriend and I had gone hunting and showed up to this bar in our camouflage. You would have thought we were aliens by the way people looked at us. We just wanted to try some good beer via a Groupon I found. Service was okay but the overall atmosphere was unwelcoming. The beer was good. I enjoyed the Coffee Nitro. My boyfriend liked the IPA but thought it was a little weak for a double. Flavors were good overall. When we left I expected some sort of conversation and I would have left a tip. Instead we were told to redeem the Groupon on our own and that was it. Customer service is a must! My advice would be to welcome people from all walks of life, not just the local hipster crowd."
iJ9buq-2r9Inl1hpdzayIA,"A little bit off the beaten path, but defiantly worth the trip. GREAT selection of beers. Cool little tasting room, and a food truck outside. I sampled plenty of beer, but didn't try any food, I will next time! What ever you guys are doing, KEEP IT UP!"
WigaVF_uJv79m8_m8_C23g,There's a great Groupon out for the place. I would Highly recommend the restaurant to any locals in the area that enjoy a good beer
1udJhWROJVwO2jKxc7Xi1g,"Awesome beers, awesome tasting room, great service.  Met Dave and he got me all hot and bothered."
YOZhlfq4KI9tU7B6zb9baw,"Excellent beer. Best brewery we visited on our short trip to Phoenix. Their collaboration with Modern Times ""BINGO BANGO BONGO IPA"" was amazing. We didn't get a chance to try the food, but we will definitely be back next time we are in the area."
wQ_raMLv0inJIkmGl1MNpA,"The guys running this place are awesome. They are very knowledgeable and friendly, and have turned this into one of the best places in Tempe. I have been a few times and the first time I thought it was difficult to find coming from Mill and around the train tracks. This time I came right off Rio Salado and it was right there. Much easier coming from that side. 

They have a great selection of beers, and always something new. The DIPA is a staple and one of the best in town. I had a couple of new IPAs this time (Church Music and Circus Bandit). Both were great. They also have crowlers available in the cooler. They do not have a food kitchen, but there is a food truck that stays there and serves excellent food. The inside bar is very nice with a lot of space, but for me the real highlight (at least for most of the year) is the patio. It is very large, has some trees, a portion of it is under a roof and makes for a great time. This past visit it was a perfect afternoon with good weather, a nice breeze, good music, and awesome beer. I could chill out there all evening.

Definitely one of my favorite breweries in Phoenix and it's run by great people. I will always support them and their beers."
EaoQYeizdAyOaiz4dQoR6w,"Great Beer, great atmosphere, great people!!! Yep the Cartel guys can't go wrong with good peeps and good beer!! Love the beer garden!"
4sNldeSqOXhRn7AFfcN-DA,"This is a neat little brewery.  They currently have four of their own beers on tap.  I tried the Hoppy Red, the Sunset Daydream IPA and the Coffee Brown on nitro.  All three of them were pretty good.  The also have a nice food truck in the parking lot.  You order the food at the truck and then they find you and deliver it to where you're sitting inside.

The servers were all friendly and very knowledgeable about craft beer."
MD117HC8ze6K-wpS7EPAcg,"We love local beer and couldn't wait to pop in here. 
Love it!! 
Good selection of dark beers. The coffee brown nitro is my favorite. I think more breweries need to make dark beers. They are smoother and less hoppy."
R4MzlCj9xkdyZf7VG8A1uA,"Great beer, great atmosphere with a really nice outdoor patio. We moved here recently from Chicago where food trucks are big at many tap rooms, none though serve food as good as what we enjoyed here from Fire & Foraged. Everything about this place is 5 stars."
muBn1Xue51M-JW65vAQ16w,"Bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable of their brews.  Beer is brewed to perfection. Clean and great prices. Food truck on property with a lunch box special that comes with food and a beer for $6, can't beat it! Food is awesome! Great place to have a beer with the people you love. Highly recommend trying it out. We will definitely be coming back!"
4rpOGFQK4thC-_aqqQkRoQ,"My friend told me about this place and it has easily become my new favorite local brewery. I usually come here on Wednesday's for their Randall (they infuse one of their beers with some other yummy ingredients)--I just recently had their pale ale with persimmons, dates and currants and it was so tasty! The food truck out back (Fire & Forged) cooks up some amazing, fresh food and switches up their menu frequently. The back patio is beautiful and dog-friendly. This place just kills it all around."
JZIzZxOwGvNClqXq9OlPvg,"Jason, Matt, Dyllon, and Dave. Great little venue! Beers are awesome and the mood is just right. If you are looking for that spot this is it. I wish you all the best and thanks for making my business a success with the local crafted beer from your brewery. I carry four of the six beers you craft and my customers up here love them. If you are ever in the neighborhood and looking for a great pairing of local crafted beers and true farm to table seafood and steaks then stop in and say hello! We are located at 32409 N Scottsdale rd. #107 Scottsdale Az. 85266. The Bourbon Cellar. We are in the Summit Plaza. CHEERS!"
qCbuE1jYnLTUarjMyXlllg,"Was in on Sunday evening. Very welcoming greeting from Brittany. Had a couple of samples. Brittany was very knowledgeable and got us just the beer we wanted. That FYITM is great. Craig at the food truck was super friendly as well. Food was awesome. Want that burger again already. The Shop has a great ambiance, better beer, and even better service. Cheers Brittany and The Shop."
8u7liI6UfwQT3QDSLpeUtw,"My wife found this place on Groupon and it was a great bang for your buck. Not to big of a selection on house beers, IPA'S & coffee. The place seemed a little quiet, I'm sure it was just the night of the week we went but still a great atmosphere. I would definitely go again."
DQB9JeyD4gRt_cnNWDBUug,"Hooray for The Shop Beer Co! They really have the small-neighborhood-brewery thing down pat. I had the pleasure of chatting with one of the brewers, Andy, at the Strong Beer Festival while sampling their limited edition releases specifically for said event. The beers I tried there were AMAZING! One was the FYITM another was a special FYITM [i think a fruity version], and something else I can't recall. 

A week or so after, I host a Sunday Funday at The Shop for a large group of friends and luckily remembered to tell Andy about it at the Festival. He and his team were gracious enough to reserve space for our group. The weather didn't want to cooperate that Sunday but when I arrived it was fairly dead inside so I pushed together large floor tables in the corner with no problems. Andy did such a great job going over the beer list many times as people came in at varied times as well as keeping track of what we ordered and making sure the glasses did not run dry. I definitely recommend doing the flight - it's $8 for 4 samples which can be a mix from The Shop and/or some from their guest beers. If I have to pick just 2 beers from The Shop to drink, #1 is the Galactic Porter Patrol nitro, #2 is Circus Bandit. 

I also recommend their food truck outside. While the guy/waiter wasn't the kindest, the food was fabulous. I really loved the chicken tacos I had. Other positives I noted were the hummus dip and burger. I believe the food menu changes often [don't quote me]. Their ordering system is kind of confusing because you have to order beer & food separately but they come out on one check. How they keep that organized, I would like to know."
Cia7yRpZPGFcDb5vU4n52g,"This place is AMAZING. My favorite things about it:

1. The beer (obviously). Bingo Bango Bongo is beyond superb, as is Church Music and of course the ol' standard, F.Y.I.T.M.

2. The music. Seriously, do you guys have a Pandora station? Whoever set that up has excellent taste and the music matches the atmosphere really well.

3. The service, both inside and at their partner food truck outside. 

You can't beat this place for a relaxing Saturday afternoon hang out or great happy hour spot. Love The Shop!!"
XdCp1hH3DEMVml0wS8bx_w,Great little brewery. I love places like this that are smaller and cozy. Nice wood inspired interior with exposed trusses and wooden bar tops. 15 beers on tap; 7 of their beers and 8 guest beers. I'll definitely be back.
UstCIoROtccjGPTE1GLWww,Food is amazing and the people are really friendly! shop is tucked away so dont miss it
ukd_lhGiOU0rgL3vIYf4cg,"Great service (Amanda) and solid but average beer. This place has potential, and they are clean with their styles if not adventurous. I look forward to what their future may hold."
vL0Y3CrU7dBjjDP2-CErYw,"Delicious fucking beer!

One of my favorite beer festivals is Made in the Shade in Flag because lots of awesome breweries show up and I get to try so many new beers.  I stumbled upon The Shop's tent in the first hour and I didn't leave.  I kept going back because they were pouring this delicious IPA that I couldn't get enough of, I didn't care what anyone else was pouring - it was that good.  

When I got back to Phoenix I couldn't find the brewery anywhere.  No one had heard of The Shop, it was like I made it all up in my drunken stupor.  Finally someone did mention the name and I got the scoop that they wouldn't be opening for until August.  I started counting down the days till opening so I could get a taste of summa that epic beer, today was that day!

My favorite brew is a double IPA is called FYITM.  Someone told me it stands for Fuck You In The Mouth and I don't know if that's true or not but I do know that my taste buds get an orgasm every time the beer enters my mouth so I think it's a solid name."
sVAmrMyXVK02SIPsPdil1g,"This is an awesome neighborhood brewery. It looks like someone's house with a food truck parked outside of it; apparently it was Mayor Mitchell's dad's home? 

Anyway, they have their own selection of brews as well as some guest beers. So far my favorites have been the Coffee Brown Nitro and the Circus Bandit. Many of their beers are a bit too hoppy for my taste, but their porters have been great. Their guest beer selections are usually pretty solid picks as well. 

Every Wednesday they do a special brew called ""The Randall"" that they infuse with their flavors of the week. Recently it was thin mints, once it was jalapenos and sometimes they serve it with an accompanying bite (once it was a donut). Follow them on Instagram for Randall announcements as well as updates about entertainment, sometimes they host bands on the patio.

They do have a food truck, Fire and Foraged, which is basically a permanent on-site fixture. They are super creative with their food and have one of the best burgers I've ever had. They source a lot of their food locally-greens from Rhiba Farms and meat from Doublecheck Ranch-and as much as I hate not being able to rely on my favorites, I like that I'm hardly eve disappointed when I try something new. I recently had a salad here with hummus on it and who knew that salad needed hummus?! 

The space is cool-lots of patio seating, about 12 seats a the bar indoors and eight 4-tops. This could be a great option to buyout for a birthday party or small wedding reception to be honest; it has nice ambiance!

This is a nice reliable place, walking distance from my house that I can just have a beer, a snack and leave pretty happy about all of it."
CLSYdPbyrnrstjl8sLZVuw,"Despite how humble and unassuming their outside is, this is in the running for one of my favorite arizona breweries. 

Beers I sampled: 
The nines red: smokey but balanced all the way through. 
Bingo bango boingo: top ten IPAs I've had in my life. Super hoppy without the bitter taste. Would love an IV drip of this...
Desert pale: usually I cling to pales but this one was overshadowed by how amazing everything else was

But wait there's more! 
Then we start talking to the owner of the food truck planted outside, Craig. Solid guy. Lots of experience in the Fox concepts and Vegas restaurants and we got to chat him up about his experience. Really great guy. We ended up getting the meat and cheese board and he knew everything  about where the meats were from, where the veggies came from, how they were pickled and everything. Can't speak highly enough of Craig or this place."
SpqEUnRiuLXS3LUHv2HPqQ,Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The vibe here is super cool and the atmosphere is inviting. This place is just getting started as it's only a few months old. I just wish we had pieces of paper to write our beer flight choices down.
ZMrq1ABIwxpw_P92HUR7uA,Amazing beer garden! Fantastic beer - love the 480! Great staff! This is already my favorite hang out place!
Qla6s5PLT9_uveUJef8_JQ,"Grab a glass and hit the beer garden! This amazing brewery in Tempe has a unique hip vibe with laid back attitude. A place you can definitely taste one of a kind beer flavors as you kick back with friends. We happened to visit during non-peak hours and we're lucky enough to spread out at a picnic table outside. From the patio lights and graffiti art, to the food truck and viewable brewery, the backyard neighborhood personality shines through. Enjoyed the 'Church Music' and 'F.Y.I.T.M' brews. Definitely a place I'd like to hit up again!"
CtGkyMMGkbBlL9J3T8dASQ,This is such a great place! I love craft beer and I'm happy to support local businesses. This might be our regular spot in Tempe. It's better than going out to Mill Ave with all of those bud light beers.
1zO-I_6HSDzRXlQM69ztjg,"This is a cute little gem off of Mill Street. My friend that goes to ASU told us about it so we decided to make the drive from Gilbert and check it out. We purchased the groupon and each got a flight, a pint, and two crowlers. It really was a great deal however, they were out of a couple of the beers we wanted to try and the food truck is... meh. Pretty pricey for what you get and our chicken and fish tacos were a little dry. The chips and dip were delicious. Homemade chips with almost like a French dip. The environment is intimate and friendly and it's not usually busy. Not sure if we'd check it out again since we tried the beers we wanted to and weren't completely sold on any. BUT cute place to stop if you're in the area."
aAZx8qzkle7T8lhvADAKdA,What a great spot and atmosphere! Oh and their beer is some of the best AZ stuff around! Can't wait to day drink there.
pqIgnSDWEkkmMzQvxplCvQ,It was just okay. Nothing special. A little small and none of the beers blew me away. It's a nice little neighborhood brewery that would be great if you live within walking distance.
c9Q-IGrLVfq5SS__SKrm_Q,"the staff are friendly and the beers was good.  those who like old school strong ipa the FYITM was made for you. ask what it stands for.  I got a 32 oz can just for the name.  good beer overall.
Alley enjoyed her time there.  everyone was friendly to her and the neighborhood had plenty of cats."
JVIGBocDkY6i-_fqZV803g,"Lots of hoppy IPA type of beers, friendly staff cool concept and always a different food truck"
MEjZU3G35cHC673wfWewIg,"Came here because they had a really good Groupon. Left extremely happy! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of their beer. We had a couple flights, liked them all. Had a couple pints and left with a couple crowlers. They have a permanent food truck outside that had some great choices and the owner and head chef came around to check on his customers. Next time I'm back in town I'll definitely be back. Keep up the good work!"
WfN__h8ZmOlqOh6NFzzUMw,"This place is great. The ceilings! That patio!  Ahh, it has such perfect lighting. I tried the nines & a special beer infused with tequila in celebration of Mexican Independence Day. Both good beers. Would be a lovely spot for small events. Talented group of people brought this place to life!"
cFlzzJMDV6imIflB11xkag,Awesome and cool place. Service was good and the beer even better. I had a flight of 4 and the double IPA is simply great should have taken a crowler of it home. Will definitely be back!
w6I2rj9vcRB-6ReTidQhbQ,"Love this place! All bartenders are amazing, service is great, has a very homey feeling and being able to hang out with the owners and brewers while you drink is exactly what you want out of a brewery! Amazing beer, especially the F.Y.I.T.M.! I recommend it to everyone I know!
Added bonus....the food truck, fire and foraged is absolutely unbelievable! All local. All grass fed. Always on sight!"
wITc4a6oS13rMBUURi3usQ,"The beer is pretty good and the food truck there is always great.  I am giving this review because they are obviously short pouring their customers.  You will note their glasses are exactly 16 ounces if they are pouring over.  They do offer some beers at a 13 oz pour but even when you get the 9 oz, 13 oz, 16 oz pours you will often get short pours for every single one of them.  I have been there over a dozen times now and easily over half of my drinks have been this way.  After a dozen visits I would say service is 60% good, 20% meh, and 20% bad.  I know it may seem minuscule to some but when you are buying premium product there should be pride in the company to give the customer what they are offering. Although they have good beer being ripped off leaves a bad taste in mouth and there are plenty of other breweries that offer just as good of beers if not better and do not rip their customers off."
tw9gPfrjTCX-zdhU7i2gFQ,"Very nice!!! Great live music.
Young people, truck food,  prices alright, good location."
IM6jPzYlxbaTX2bGTdL0dw,"Small place with three solid dark beers on tap, in addition to the more usual ipas and wheats. Enjoyed our beers very much, the server was helpful and sweet, very pleased'"
SJ0z8us-W5t-Aytykt77wQ,This place is amazing! I cannot recommend it enough from the staff to the food to their beers... I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could! We came here because of their awesome Groupon deal but we will definitely be back! They've only been open for 3 months but they are already doing a great job! If you're looking for a low key cool vibe type of place this is the place for you. It's really a hidden gem so hopefully it stays on the DL for awhile longer.
Zf6HToP7uzYlOjR86fTZ5w,Great place to have a few beers. They have a awesome outside sitting area and with the weather now you can't beat it. The server takes her time and explains the beers to you and offers suggestions. Can't wait until I have time to go back again
8AIs-KQ8JmSv3QCNRCikTQ,"Incredible asian fusion, and an impressive sake list, if you like that sort of thing. Mmmmm... coconut-crusted mahi mahi.... Just start ordering and keep going until you are full.  But save room for the dessert sampler plate."
cKuPTIJjA78dATvnrcgiSw,"Delicious food. 
Good service. 
BUT-- if you are allergic to shellfish BEWARE-- they do not label all the dishes that contain shellfish.  You might order, say, the tomato bisque or the black cod, only to find out later (the hard way) that they contain such items as shrimp paste or oyster sauce."
m29WL4DJVCiwq9bGazxdEw,"I really love Kushi Bar, it's the kind of place that I wouldn't be embarrassed to take my old friends from Boston or New York to. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the dipping sauce just adds fuel to my firey addiction to sriracha. For vegetarians, I recommend the house salad (kumquats!), kimchi tofu, mushrooms, curry veggie and rice bowl and wash it all down with the gin rickey."
1ypC-siSWIKS0XcGv8s34Q,"I'm a little wary of Asian fusion restaurants, and I wasn't sure quite what to expect from Muramoto, but my dining partners (a chef and a personal chef) and I were thoroughly pleased with our light dinner on Saturday evening. 

We had two rolls, one eel and avocado and another tuna, avocado and some other stuff - both were fantastic. After seeing someone else with it, we also ordered the calamari with slaw and chili paste and, by far the best dish of the evening, the black miso seared cod. I've been remembering that cod all weekend, it was so good. There were a lot of other things on the menu that I wanted to try as well. Maybe another time.

Actually, everything was really, really good. This was a place I would want to revisit if I lived in Madison. Although we didn't order anything off it, they did have a specials menu with at least three items, and the very extensive sake menu. 

Contrary to what one of the other reviewers said, I think it would be really hard for the average person to spend $100 alone unless you just stuffed yourself silly. We ordered five dishes total and two small bottles of sparking sake to share among three women and the bill was $85. Actually I couldn't quite believe how reasonable the bill was when it came. 

BTW, make reservations. We weren't in a hurry, so we went and had a drink and came back, but the dining area is quite small, so if you have more than two people you'll definitely want to call ahead on a weekend evening."
FhVvlurmgtZy6kkQO2xfEg,"Muramoto is a paradise if you are a sake lover. Their collection is enormous and I believed the owner claimed Muramoto has the best collection in midwest. If you are a sake lover and haven't been there, what  are you waiting for? and if you don't usually drink sake, you should still try the sake out (especially the ones list under fragrant) and you might change your view about sake forever.

For the food Muramoto is Asian fusion in tapas style. Although each plate might be only around $10, most of them are not filling (rolls are the exceptions) and at the end combining your sake bill the check might cost as much as $100 per person."
5bGJn27l6uqgpdsWV02s-A,"[NOTE:  this review is about Restaurant Muramoto, which used to be in the location currently occupied by Kushi Bar, but has since moved down the street 2 blocks.]

In a handful of visits since it opened a few years ago, I've found Muramoto to have generally outstanding food and often less-than-ideal service.  IMO, the former more than makes up for the latter, which is at its worst just a bit slow and unconcerned.  (Once, for example, we were two dishes into our meal before our first round of drinks arrived.)

But, ahh, the food.  This is probably the most creative food in Madison.  I describe it as pan-asian fusion in a tapas form factor.  There is some sushi, and some is even pretty good (I'm thinking of the signature duck mango avocado rolls).  That said, it's a mistake to think of Muramoto as a sushi place, though (there is a Muramoto sushi restaurant in the hilldale area ) -- my favorite dishes here have included the soy cod, a lamb curry, and a few amazing salads.  In my experience, the oft-changing menu contains little that isn't great -- an omnivore with an open-minded palate could safely close their eyes and just start pointing.

Come with an appetite and prepare to spend a bit of change (dinner for 2 with drinks and dessert will exceed $100), and avoid the tables in the front near the door on cold days."
av2d1ll29hrtUYhZYJJN0g,"Like Leslie S. said Muramoto has a somewhat limited menu but what is on that menu is outstanding.  I adore places that encourage tapas style/family dining and Muramoto's portions are what some may describe as small.  (Two to share two entrees is just enough food.) Additionally I appreciate that food is brought out as it is done being prepared and does not suffer death under a heat lamp.
For drinks I had Lychee Liquor and grapefruit juice which was mango-ey and so tasty. I'd consider coming back just for that concoction alone.  We ordered the Tuna with Wasabi Flying Roe, Shrimp in Spicy Coconut Sauce, and the Pan Seared Scallop. (which was the favorite dish)  All of our food embodied unique flavors, and were demonstrations of  ""Asian fusion"" done right.  Our server was incredibly helpful with questions, and prompt without seeming as if she was trying to rush us out the door.  
Also prices were not that bad.  For 2 entrees, 1 roll, and drinks we exited the restaurant only about $60-ish poorer (including tip). I am definitely returning. I wish the restaurant was bigger and took reservations because I'd rent out the whole place for graduation."
kAFyjie8UClchNTpIsM4TQ,"Kushi bar will close at the end of August (may already be closed)
http://77square.com/food/restaurants/story_462727"
jXarz-fPsDFLSfwHym1gzQ,"Wandered in here looking for the restaurant and they told me to go down the street.  They have some food, but it's not the same as the full restaurant.  However, their shochu drinks are more extensive at this location, so I had a shochu shiso mojito.  It was okay--not my favorite, but not bad either.  Maybe I should have tried a drink that wasn't trying to be another drink.  

Anyway, the place is really nice, the bartenders are really nice.  Well worth a visit."
FQl1geZHUfSeUTwbXZRQ_w,best meal i had since coming to Madison.(Been here 2 months) I would say that this place serves fusion Japanese Food. My recommendation is that this is the place to go with friends so that you can share dishes and try more stuff. Food quality is top notch and each dish really offers you a new experience. Only gripe about the place is that portions are SMALL and it's relatively pricey. expect to spend 20 plus per pax. A must try is their dessert sampler! Definitely going back : )
LFTVAZQ7jOQbF07x1bGpdA,"Although I regularly miss Dog Eat Dog around noon every week day, I'm pleased that Muramoto replaced it and gave us a place to blow our cash on Sunday nights. The chef's tasting is key. And use the bathroom with the sink that makes you want to get out your GI Joes and Barbies and play in the bubbles all night."
HyVFtiiJqbPKNQZ1QmZRBA,"Please note: Pricey, gourmet Restaurant Muramoto has moved down the street, and Kushi Muramoto has become a sort of ""Izakaya"" style place. Think Japanese Tapas. Reviews prior to November at this location should be thought as applying to it's new location, just down the street. 

I was not impressed by the food at Kushi. Your order will come out quickly, because almost everything is fried, fried, fried. The exception is the Donburi -- something yummy on rice. Our Eel Donburi was solid, and decently priced for $8... but if you're a Midwesterner with a healthy appetite like me, don't think this will make a meal. 

I also have a complaint about the drinks. My Cosmo was delicious -- and also standard Cosmo size and price ($7). However, because they make all their mixed drinks here with sake instead of vodka, what you're getting really packs much less of a punch than what you'd get elsewhere.

The pluses are this: The atmosphere hasn't change since this was the pricey Muramoto, So it's a groovy low-lighting place to hang. Also, it's really reasonably priced. $4 drafts. $1.50-$2 things on a stick, $5.50-$8 for Donburi. So you can go out and feel like you're getting the ""Muramoto Experience"" without bleeding yourself dry.

However, when they said ""fried Snickers are our only dessert and they're only 2 for a dollar,"" I was so sick of panko fried tidbits, I said ""no"" without a moment or regret."
1OWxam36s3CdkBLB1nozxQ,"Oh my did this place not live up to the hype.  It was heinous how sloppy our rolls came out, my date's food came out a full 20 minutes after my own, and the black cod was incredibly salty.  The place looked ""hip"" but that's about as cool as it got.   If you are looking to make a fashion statement then by all means dress yourself up and head to Muramoto, if you are looking to enjoy your meal (be it tapas, sushi, real japanese or some fusion) look elsewhere."
Toh-YLCULBVXyWsgn1_pPg,"This place accommodated our party of 8 well-sauced gentlemen nicely. Our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful with our menu choices. Her recommendation of one roll and another fairly small plate was the perfect amount of food for us, as we had more beers to consume apres-dinner. 

I got the impression this is one of the nicer restaurants in Madison, because everyone was dressed up. Except us of course. In Chicago this would be a nicer-than-average sushi restaurant, but it's not on par with Japonais. Think more along the lines of Sushi Ra if the food at Sushi Ra were a lot better. Sort of a modern, almost trendy thing going on, with a pronounced wet bar. 

The food was good, but to be perfectly honest, I have no business reviewing a sushi restaurant since I usually don't get any of the real shit. If it's crispy and fried or if the flavor of the fish is masked by jalepeno, avocado, or cream cheese, that's just fine with me. 

So yeah, sorry I made you read this review for nothing."
ose5bGJUQo86HS2yHQjiXA,"ASIAN FUSION WITH INCREDIBLE SAKE MENU.

All info I've seen says 'tapas style', but I will tell you - these plates are not too small, and quite filling. Their other spot cross town is an incredible sushi restaurant with everything under the sun. Here, only have a few rolls on the menu (and they are incredible), but that is not why you come. Come for the tasty, hot dishes, and for the sake flights.

Every so often, you eat a meal that is soooo good, so perfect in almost every way, and the tastes are so unforgettable, that you want to get right up then and there, and do what I affectionately call, The Food Dance. This is food that makes your eyes roll back into your head with every bite, and leaves you wondering where the hell you have been eating all these years. This was, hands down, my saving grace in Madison. Presentation of the food is spectacular. Eating alone? Sit at the bar and stare at um-teen bottles of Japanese sake. Eating with a group? Even better, as the sushi rolls they do have there (soft-shell crab or avocado and mango roll w/ thin-sliced duck breast on top, drizzled with a duck reduction sauce, or a few others) are HUGE. Don't think California sushi, as each roll which costs $10 has about ten large slices, and you will find it hard to eat an entire one by yourself. These rolls would easily be double the price if this was in SF.  Look for Michael, the tall, bald-shaven, server/barman that knows everything about the menu, and can recommend many good sakes on the list. Try the sake flight (3 glasses) for a nice accompaniment to any meal. Now for the best part........you want small slices of some of the tastiest beef anywhere? Get the hangar steak. Not a large portion (meaning not a whole steak) but you get several slices of this beef, drizzled with a white miso-bleu cheese sauce that is to DIE FOR. Not a fan of bleu cheese? No worries, as the taste is made subtle by the combining with miso. But please, do yourself a favor - ORDER THIS DISH! Not a big beef fan? That's fine, as the Grilled Miso Black Cod is their signature dish. My suggestion? Start with some sake, and order yourself one sushi roll, and one hot dish. Take a few people, and everyone order a few different things, and share. And won't you be happy when you get out of there, after all this tasty food, and still you are not over the per diem. And if you are, maybe you shouldn't have had that third drink. Be advised - this place has a little wooden sign in the window, and it took me forever to find it. Do me one better, and take the address WITH YOU when you go!"
VgPnYAOJdFF_vD0GaFUNag,"Who says the Midwest can't have tasty seafood?  Dim and intimate, Muramoto is easily one of my favorites places in Madison.  A varied menu with some fantastic Asian-inspired cuisine, this ain't your grandmother's Friday night fish fry.

Update:  swing by on Sunday night to try the blind chef's tasting.  4 courses ending in dessert for $30.  Never disappointing."
xsdVuL20EEzRR_MavYAIVg,"I had my first visit since they turned into a tapas bar style spot. 
Got to say, they're still serving the best ""imitation"" of the real stuff - doesn't really fly by me. 

But if you like that kind of thing, I suppose it's ok. Depending on the bartenders, some drinks are so underwhelming that it made me feel unnecessarily girly.  Oh well. 

On the positive note, I think it is fun to try out many small plates. So 3 stars for the fun factors. The hype doesn't match the food, though."
N6uMLOhrhQUmkwU9Iv97NQ,"I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!) 

I end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!"
XRzpHvkivRV9yHdjiNJ8ng,"There were only a handful of rolls available at $10 each that are very fulfilling.  I would recommend the soft shell crab roll.  For some reason the Duck, Mango and Avocado roll made my stomach really queasy.  I didn't try the sake because it was a Monday night, but I would come back for the oyster shot!  A mixture of oyster, raw quail egg and spices it was something very unique!  I had two before my meal.  Slurrrrrp!"
WRvtog3sUIYxcYdJO-srYw,"Yep, I did it- 5 stars.

After a few missed attempts at going to muramoto, we finally made it in.

We tried some sake to start it off, and the Wakatake was superb- at the suggestion of the waiter. Next were the oyster/quail egg shots. What a nice melding of flavors. This was followed by the corn/lemongrass chowder- big disappointment, but I'll let it slide.

On to the main courses- started with the tuna/mayo roll. This was a quite a big portion and really was a great sushi roll for those that like the bells and whistles. The hangar steak was tasty. The bleu cheese sauce was just perfect and made the steak that much better. Could have used just a tad more crust on the meat. Finally, we had the miso black cod. This is how fish should taste. It melted in your mouth, and was salty, but in a great way. 

TIP- go early or late (after 9) because they don't take reservations."
RItK2tnwM2QMw1sg9T7hGQ,"Yum!  Muramoto is really the best place in Madison for Sushi.  Period.  The service is always great, not just that they are prompt and attentive, but they know the menu and the drink menu and can make intelligent recommendations that I am usually pleased with.  Muramoto's creative rolls are SO delicious, they are all different tasting and the only comparison to their taste comes from good sushi places in Chicago.  I get take out here at least once a week and dine here about once or twice a month.  If you want fantastic sushi at really a quite reasonable price, this is your place!"
NDJPlFn9agAkfyo7mMB4Vw,"Just to be clear, this is a review of the new 'tapas-style' Muramoto.  Ok, with that out of the way....

The Space:  Just like the old Muramoto that was there, its a great space and feels like a 'big city' restaurant.  Dark, calm, cool, and the lighting is superb.  Great date place and it just feels sexy.

The Food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.  We ordered a wide variety of small plates and not ONE of them was good.  In fact, even they even managed to blow bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese.  Now thats not easy to screw up.  The plates ranged from merely ok to bad (octopus 'balls' were like fried croquettes with elastic bands in the middle).  

The Drinks:  Drinks were good.  Good pours, good selection and the Japanese booze was interesting.  

The Price:  Here's why Kushi Bar received an extra star.  The place is cheap for what it is, especially the drinks.

So all in all, go for drinks, ambiance and to impress a date.  Maybe even order a small plate or two but don't expect it to taste as gourmet as it sounds on the menu..."
csePl2jSG6teWWuGVys7cA,"Muramoto has moved into its new space and its all good (great space, expanded menu, same great staff)...but, I strangely miss the old space. Maybe some therapy for this reviewer."
Z4wqE0K0w3lOHMY4jVBqwA,"I like this place.  The food and the service is great.

Sesame Crusted Big Eye Tuna with tahini sauce - I love it!  The sauce is so nutty and tasty and goes perfectly with the tuna and mixed greens.

Rock Crab Croquettes - it's their version of crab cakes but they deep fry the croquettes (4) and they arrive at your table piping hot.  They're delicious! - reminds me of my beloved dungeness crabs back home.   

Shrimp and Spicy Coconut Sauce with crushed peanuts - this is pretty good.  It's very similar to Thai food.

Hangar Steak with bean salad in bleu cheese & miso dressing - both times I've had it it's been a little tough and very chewy.  The bean salad (scattered around the steak on a long rectangular plate) drenched in the dressing is quite good.

DESSERTS
We ordered the Sample Platter.  I'm glad we did because we were able to try some really interesting desserts.  This Platter is perfect for two people.

Yuzu (Japanese Citrus Fruit) Panna Cotta - a little more firm than normal panna cotta.  Didn't really taste the citrusy fruit.  But it was very good.  It kind of reminded me of a smoother version of cheesecake without the graham cracker crust.  It also had a drizzle of some berry compote.

Strawberry Spring Roll w/Honey ginger ice cream - I really liked the spring roll.  It was nice and hot and I think there was some sweetened sticky rice in it as well.  I'm a big fan of ginger but for some reason I didn't like the ice cream.

Honey Black Sesame Creme Brulee - this was not my favorite but it was interesting.  The creme wasn't super creamy but had a little texture to it.  The color of the creme was a dark charcoal grey and tasted like smokey sesame.  It's a clever idea but not something I would try again.

Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash) Cheesecake - pumpkiny cheesecake with cinnamon or nutmeg with maple syrup lining the plate was my favorite."
GvvwtTL0KEqO9l8qNIgQ9w,"I will never look at sushi the same way again!  I am a huge sushi addict, and this is above and beyond the best place to get your ""fix"" in Madison.  It even beats the places in DC that I've tried, and they do a cool new take on  rolls.  Everything was fantastic, my date and I ate 'til we were stuffed...then had dessert on top of that (a delicious creme brulee).  At $10 a roll, these are more than worth the price..they are huge and come with their own individual sauces...no wasabi or soy needed.  We had a saki flight...not my thing, but good to try once I guess.  Service was great and I love the atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back!"
Rg9aSqytD0jCMEkvwpdY2g,"The food here is amazing.  Kushi is like Japanese tapas - all small plate dishes here.  I went here on a date and enjoyed everything we ordered.  It was pretty deserted on a Tuesday night, but I've seen more people there on the weekend.  The ambiance is loungy - and pretty dark, so it gives off a romantic vibe.  A bit expensive, but worth it."
pubTy2GEizrk1Es638wgIA,"Muramoto is a very good restaurant if you enjoy a limited selection of very good things.  The duck roll is outstanding as are the oyster shots, which are my favorite way to start dinner.

Criticism-wise, there is a bit of a problem with seating in the wintertime, as there is quite a draft coming in from the door if you sit too close to it.  Moreover, you cannot make reservations at Muramoto.  This means of course that you cannot request a table further away from the door if you want to in advance (first come first serve).

Service is just fine, ambiance is lovely.  Come with a date, not your kids and definitely not in your red UW sweatshirt.  Dress to impress; this is a spot for grownups only.

!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!! 
Downtown Muramoto has moved to an new location, which is interestingly just down the road from their old location.  This solves the drafty chill issue, there are LOTS more seats, and you can now make rezzos.  On the downswing, it's missing something of its original, uniquely Madisonian charm.  It now has vaulted ceilings, adequate lighting, and at least one waitress of questionable moral character.  Plus they have an additional location by the Hilldale Mall which is yet another step down.  I think what I'm saying is that Muramoto sold out to the man and is now no longer actually hip or trendy.  But honestly, it's still quite nice and the food is very good.  The new Hilldale location does not have the oyster shots, but they do have a delicious octopus salad which knocks me sockies off.  You might as well keep going."
4OPwwkmk8ScShnPmADDklw,"Graduated in 2012, school was ok. Nothing really hard even though I took honor classes and one Peggy Pane class. Some of the teachers are cool though such as Ms. Gazier. Take her if you take honors chem. There's also Mr. Barkdoll. He's always funny and makes math really fun. Another teacher would be Mr. Bailey. Very easy going guy and an easy A if you show some effort and not be obnoxious. Some of the stuff isn't mandatory, such as Pep rallys, just sleep in and go to class 15 minutes before the pep rally ends. Basically, just enjoy high school on how easy and how little responsibilities you have before going to college."

It's nice and clean and bright and open. I have been getting my nails done for 18 years and this is by far the best nail salon I have been to.
S-z4ILqGFVw6aWUGb6MfmA,First time at this place and they just got a loyal customer. Service was amazing and the spa pedicure was the best I've had in years! The gels nails were also great and a great hand/arm massage to come with. The price wasn't bad either!!! I am definitely coming back!!!
EED4CsAw7vYaZ7JUkDSutA,"WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! Unprofessional. Disloyal. Rude. Lazy. After giving this place and my nail tech Kim business for over a year, I was turned away today because I like my nails buffed too much. Seriously? You mean you don't want to ""work"" for the money I pay you. WTF? I've never been so insulted. And I'm not even a difficult client. In the year I've been going here, Kim has barely said two words to me (which is Ok. I just want my nails done). I continued to go back week after week because she was good. Six months ago I walked in without an appt and let someone else do my nails. Mistake. She cut me and the buff was awful. Kim actually stepped over to finish the job. And I tip well for good service. 

So understand how floored I was when I was told today Kim doesn't want to work on me any more. I was told her arm hurts too much after buffing my nails and she feels awkward. You're kidding, right? Now, if I was a jerk customer; demanding, loud, lousy tipper, etc I can see it. But I'm none of that. In fact, when I find what I like, I'm loyal. And I've been loyal here. And I pay without complaint. And I tip well, always. That's why I'm so pissed to have been turned away because the job is too difficult. That's just lazy! Yes, L-A-Z-Y!!! You perform a service. I pay you money. I have the right to be particular. You have the responsibility to do your job well. Today, they lost a customer and a fan. What happened today was BS. 

I will NEVER recommend this business. I'm disappointed I can't give a zero star or negative star rating. Fancy Nails gets a big middle finger from me!"
iPEwU7etTIJWS7NLbvkPsg,"I read reviews about this salon that were mixed so I decided to try it for myself. I called prior to actually going to the salon to find out prices as well as make an appointment. The girl who answered the phone took about 5 minutes to figure out what the cost of a basic pedicure was. Then I scheduled an appointment for 11am on Sunday. I get there just before 11 and no one greets me, I finally get the attention of the girl who answers the phone and let her know I have an 11am appointment for a pedicure. She says oh okay pick a color and we'll be right with you. I wait 10 minutes, then they have me sit in a pedicure chair. Another 15 minutes waiting for someone to finally become available to do my toes.  Holly did a really great job, but waiting 25 minutes after I made an 11oclock appointment is disappointing.  I go to pay and the girl who answers the phones also takes care of the payments. She seriously had no clue what she was doing. She asked me what it cost and I said $22 as It stated on the menu.  This girl up front really has to get it together, she is completely clueless. I am sorry to say I won't be back to this establishment."
gFwl1YVLgtqfXoejnSyRCw,"I love this nail shop and I am very, very particular. It's super clean, with disposal liners in the pedi chairs. The decor is very cute. They have coffee and water for clients. They're a a wide variety of colors and brands of polish. Love Teresa's work and Tina gives great pedis too. They ensure their customers are happy."
sLu1Dk0ddcPWJKiQbagFaA,This place is so clean. They engage you and talk directly to you and no cross talking. The owner runs a tight ship and you can tell. I really like coming here and always leave satisfied. They do such a good job. A spa pedi is only 22 and its amazing. Go here!
jZg1Esr3g5HzNXTv-xMZFA,"Awesome experience, Brenda took her time and did a great job. Salon was clean, prices were reasonable."
bJWFSHLznBZTEya2zTY9Aw,This Salon is beautiful.. Very clean..people are friendly... Diana Hackett is amazing....great nails ..great Pedis'
KJyPjXOAyxh8g5FdivGVGg,"Came here yesterday for a gel mani and pedi . Clean salon and disposable liners in foot tubs Appreciated that they soaked my acrylic off instead of trying to ""pop"" them off . Tina did both my hands and feet and both are completely on point . Not to mention she took extra care and detail , plus the massage was amazing . I like that they offer a menu of ad ons for their pedicures as well , I love options . I will be back to this salon and will book an appointment with Tina again . Thanks Guys !"
-C5-uwUvwKanEQYSEyIAeQ,"love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try.  each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2-3 weeks since march.  i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure.  I haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments.  

the have great selection of gel/ shellac/ gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services. 

go during the week!  their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week.  that being said they like to take their time during the week.  sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch.  (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes)  i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare."
M8pkXkyFYm90hIFKyjV3tA,Very impressed... Hannah did a great job.  I love the disposable liners for pedicures.  The only drawback was that I had to wait about 35 minutes for the appointment I made in advance.. But I would certainly recommend!
pjnpbMIv1yZup7hzXcnVgQ,Had an absolutely wonderful experience here this past weekend! Steven was in town and did not nails with a gel manicure. He did a great job and took his time.. I did not feel rushed one bit. This will be my new favorite place to go.
cTi1DLsrzPDkAEIMmex5Xw,Steven is the best here. He listens and does what you ask. No sharp square nails here. He does a great French pedicure. The price is great can't beat it.
RsouMT7ipbxbyuHajom9bg,"I'm only in Phoenix visiting, and this salon is by far one of the best I have seen. I wish I lived here so I could come get my nails done here more often. They have complimentary coffee and tea at the entrance :) They have great service too! Ask for Kim or Steven to do your nails!"
xxuk_t_kJ6ou4Lq8PcxwVw,Awesome price of $25 for a gel mani. Lots of OPI gel colors too! Everyone is really nice and takes their time. My favorite place :)
dWLY51_zP5ojsRKctmeQHg,Salon is trendy and certainly FANCY! Pedicure includes a wonderful and lengthy foot and leg massage. Hundreds of nail polish color options and competitive pricing. I'll be back!
kWJUK09q7GMnqrh3lX_QJw,"I recently moved to this salon after 5 years somewhere else that was close by. This salon is great. Great prices, very clean and great service. The techs dont sit on their phone the entire time you are there :) I will be ditching the other salon and using this place from now on! Great find. Highly recommend!"
i61h1HHTO0OWXZwhEncqcA,"Last week was first visit to Fancy Nail.  It is clean, they use disposable trays for pedis.  The pedi was nice, good massage, lots of colors to choose from, offered bottled water.  One of my toes got messed up from her putting my flipflop back on, but she fixed it right away.  I also had an acrylic nail fill with gel polish & top coat.  She did a good job of keeping them thin, nice colors to choose from, although they longer use Shellac.  I never felt rushed the whole time I was in there and everyone was nice.  However, when trimming my cuticles, she cut mine & it was bleeding~Not Good because No nail salon puts new tips on their drill for every new customer :(
I think I would go back for a pedi but def not for a nail fill."
g7CqiOoJBdlQbMHMRnNXOA,"I just moved to Phoenix and decided to try this place out. It's very clean, lots of colors to choose from, and close to my house. Every time it come in here they seemed very rushed and try to get you out of the door as quickly as possible. No room for relaxation. One time I did back my nails done by Steven, he's by far the best and takes his time. I'll probably be branching out if I can't reserve with him in the future."
0gYj10HFOxNHgNxFw5l5yw,"Still getting great service several years later! I've never have a bad experience here, even when they are packed with customers.
To those that are especially particular or love a more pampering experience and for the tech to take more time with them, try going during the week and during the day. If you like extra pampering, why would you go at the busiest time? It's common sense to go when they don't have a lot of other people to distract them and common sense to not go at the end of the day when they are exhausted and ready to go home, especially if you are a walk-in. That is with ANY business. 
 Their busy time, btw, is weekends, especially late in the day."
3i0fLDrf96-9ZPorrJPpVQ,"I love this place! They give great services for the price. I got a mani and a pedi there and they were by far the cheapest, and the cleanest!! They take care of their clients. The best part, is they rememer you! it had been a while since I went there and they mentioned that to me. I will definately be going back there!"
tO-HnpAcUXdq_601ng2jug,"First time at Fancy today. Walk-in appointment and I got sat immediately with Ha. She was very good! Very clean and quick technique. The salon is very nice and welcoming...they offer coffee, water, etc. I recently moved to the area and will definitely be back!!"
b4O1WjOxBBCVggeiPHzEEQ,"I often travel to Phoenix, but I've never been able to find a great nail salon that's the trifecta: clean, reasonably priced, and does great shellac...until now. 

I called to check to see if I could come in without an appointment and was able to get in right away. I was greeted by the salon owner, who removed my old shellac and then prepped my nails. His next appointment arrived, so he sent me over to HaLee, who did my nails. She was awesome - precision shellac, super-nice, and very quick! 

The salon is very clean and tastefully decorated. The cost of the manicure was very reasonable, considering what nearby salons were trying to charge. 

I'll definitely visit again! Very happy."
XE5cH2N76p3VH2p_2n_A2Q,"I have been having my nails done now for over 30 years, and over this time frame, I have lived in 3 different states. I had to go to several different shops here in Arizona, since moving here 17 years ago, before I found the right one. I was very happy at that salon for almost 10 years. During those 10 years, I went to the same nail tech,for about 8 of the 10 years,he did
a great job, my nails lasted, and all was well! 
For personal reasons I had to find a new salon.
So I went to a new place, it had high reviews and I got a new set and a gel pedicure! Everyone was nice and all looked okay, but they were so SLOW I was there 5 HOURS!!...I couldn't imagine ever going back there again, they were closed for over an hour, and I was still in there , the ONLY 1 in there!.....Not fun! 
So I was stressed after that  , and knew I needed to  find a new place so now I am in the present time, and brings me to my review here today.  I took my time,and for 2 weeks,  I really did my homework. I researched, googled. read reviews, and finally decided on where I would go.  I chose Fancy Nails & Spa on Cave Creek Rd in Phoenix.  I didn't just make an appointment either. After I was done with all my research , I called about  4 of  the salons,  and went in person,  to see the salons, and speak to them, as well, as look at there selections of powders / colors. 
When I first called Fancy nails I spoke to the Owner David, he was very friendly. He offered for me to come in, and take a look, and told me they would take care of me, When I went to the shop, again he was friendly, I decided to make an appointment. For a new set and gel pedicure with Kim also eye brow wax.
They didn't have the chunky/confetti powder that I am used to, but assured me they could order at a later time.My nails seemed okay, I was just glad to have them done, and have found a place, that I didn't  pay to close attention.As the holidays were fast approaching and I was very busy at that time. The gel pedicure was good looked nice. But I was a bit disapointed that my, toe nails were grown out so quickly, as I had said please make them extra short, I like them short. And even after she first cut them, I asked her to trim off more, glad I did, because they were still to long. I figured though it was my first time, so next time it will be better. 
I always got compliments  on my nails, especially the last 10 years. Well all of a sudden no one is complimenting me?! I thought that is really strange?!
After a couple days I looked harder at my nails and I could see every little mark under the pink area?...and it looked weird....they never looked like that before. . I had them use medium pink, same thing I had always used, for 10 years . Then still no compliments, and each day they looked worse... it was like you could see all the drill marks straight through it, on my nail beds. I went back to my next appointment because now new years Eve was here, and I had a party to go to. This time the same thing happened with my nails, and my pedicure also. Now my daughter is asking me whats wrong with my nails?...And even my husband!. They don't  look nice anymore, my husband says. I wanted to cry. So I called the nail salon and spoke to David the owner, he said come in and he would take care of me himself.
So I did, and he said they needed to be removed, and cleaned up underneath, and a whole new set, and he would take care of me, and he did!...:) So now everything will be okay..right?
wrong!!....
It helped,  But he had to drill my nail beds way way down a lot and it hurt real real bad to do that!...I had another pedicure by a different tech, once again I explained they were left to long  2 times, and I like them extra short,  make them very short. They said yes but, they did not.
After 2 weeks ( and still no compliments) I was beside myself. So I made my appointment with David again, thinking Id try one more time. And when I got there I showed him all the drill marks on my nail beds. He then showed his daughter Hannah, and had her do my nails.She said would do back / fill and use ""her"" medium pink powder.  and it will cover all those marks. She then proceeded, without saying anything to literally rip off my finger nail, it hurt!. I pulled away, in pain, and said, no! you need to soak them off!..and she laughed!! and said I was sensitive and begin to rip again!.OMG!I couldnt believe it now there was BLOOD! and a huge throbbing pain she laughed again! I had tears It hurt for the whole time, she was not even sorry.When she was finally finished, They looked good, so I thought it might be Okay Well wrong again! 2 days later 1 nail was lifting!..I called Hannah.Can she please fix it? She said to busy!!..Maybe tomorrow!!?? I got really upset. Then she said ok come in.The owner David looked at it, he fixed it, and never said 1 word to me the whole time.I knew right then, I would not be returning. Next day another nail lifted and came off 1 by 1 til all are gone just shy of 12 days! OMG"
-wlzNwfH69QbN3qry2zWig,"I was looking for a nail parlor that was close-ish to my area, and this place by far had the best and most consistent reviews. Called to make an appointment to do my gel nails, and the man on the phone was very clear about directions. Upon arriving there i can absolutely see why people might get lost. They're tucked into the back of a complex on Rose Garden lane. Easiest way to get there would be to turn and go east onto Rose Garden lane and then turn left (north) into the red brick complex. They're straight ahead of you there. 

It's a nice new place, and was pretty busy when I got there, even though it was 1000 on a Saturday and they had only opened at 0900. Most people were actually there for pedis. Since I had an appointment I was seated almost right away, and they got down to removing my previous gel manicure and get a new one on me.

I do have to make a disclaimer- I hadn't always had a great experience with gel nails. I did them for my wedding and loved them, and went back to get them done after they grew out, for a bachelorette party in Vegas. The removal process was horrid- they used this thing to scrape the stuff off and it felt awful. And then I left, went shopping and literally in an HOUR had a giant chip. Of course there was no time to go back and get it fixed. It was a very disappointing experience.

But getting mine done when I was out of town had been pleasant, and my best friend said she was addicted to them. So I decided to give it a shot again. 

And I'm glad I did. The removal process here was quick and painless- the gel manicure crumbled off when it came time to scrape it off, no awful sensations necessary. They had a great range of colors, and my lady even tried to recommend another color for me. (I wound up sticking with the color I wanted). The nails were beautifully done, and she did them promptly- I was in and out of the place in under an hour. I did decide to wait about a week to do a review, to see how well these puppies wear. The manicure I had prior to this chipped a bit on the thumbs within a week, which was also a bit disappointing.

A week and these nails look as good as they did when I left the salon. I'm hard on my nails too- I pound at a keyboard, and have two big, rough dogs at home. These still look great- no chips, wonderful shine. 

I think I might have found my newest addiction, and I'll definitely be back to get them done again! 

Please do note that you can pay with DEBIT cards, but not credit. Also, like several reviewers noted below- bring CASH to tip."
xN4aQpzixhMtr5yKUiqfzg,"Im a regular at fancy nails, I just love their staff and service.  They just moved the salon a few doors down to a bigger spot, which has better air ventilation(no nail odor).  I usually come with a big party because they have plenty of room to accommodate us all.  I get SNS and a pedicure which last me about three weeks.  Highly recommend this salon."
wBKpE7i1bqlxwNK_vgYvFw,Best Salon ever! I'm so sad to be moving soon and I will miss David and Steven terribly.
kCUMAS6w3p8s82j3SqxA2A,"Since I moved to Phoenix, I've happily driven 18 miles (one way) to have my nails done here.  Definitely the cleanest nail salon I've ever seen.  I like that they use disposable liners in the pedicure tubs.  Amazing colors of gel and regular polish.  Friendly and detailed staff.  Wish I could give 10 stars.  Very reasonably priced."
FcU_P_BNsHnMsAvFKdAZiA,"Been coming to Fancy Nails for a few months. The place is very nice offering a number of features that give it an edge-nice decor, curtains separating some of the pedi chairs, a Keurig machine with coffee. Pedicures are relaxing and thorough. Very skilled nail technicians with both gel and acrylic. Got a nice bottle of lotion as a thank you Christmas gift last month. My new nail place!"
PKjIhafXlHEgtiMrpLjo8A,Best & cleanest nail shop in Northeast Phoenix!  David & his nail techs have the latest colors!  Try the mood gel polish!  Changes color in cold or with water!  They have liners in tubs and keep everything very clean!  You will love it here! Thanks David & awesome nail techs!
oIxBBbqCsMoNuUzEchEeiQ,"I'm a business owner myself. I made an appointment the day before to get a gel pedicure, and a back fill. The reviews I read were really great. I'd been seeing the same nail tech for 6yrs and never had I complained. However she moved to California. They put me with a guy that didn't speak any English. I get my pedicure & nails done every 10 days. this young man took 90mins doing nothing! He put callus remover on my feet and then place them in the water Hmmm... I wonder where he got his nail tech license? He didn't remove the skin or calluses on my feet after putting callus remover on them. The shape of my toenails are not the same or even. Oh! And he forgot to massage my feet!! Then the owner came over and told me that they're really busy and couldn't do my nails and could I come back tomorrow and he would do a very good job on my nails for me!! 
I sat in that chair for 90 minutes frustrated with this moron that shouldn't be doing pedicures or any other kind of service. It was inadequate & way below average customer service. I watched the owner book appointments for ladies that just walked in with no appointment and ask them to come back in 20mins. Well I dealt with being stressed out by someone that was not properly doing their service then being told that they didn't have time to do my nails because they were too busy! I was charged $48 for something that I most certainly was not happy with. I told the owner to stick it up his A..

How can anyone be so rude I don't know? I wish there was a law or a requirement that in order to get your license to be a nail technician or to perform any kind of public service that every individual of any race needed to speak and understand The English language fluently before they were able to obtain their license!  
I owned 2 hair salons in scottsdale and I don't ever recommend anyone going to fancy nails."
1ctLdRJjP9m5QdL7ruYAzA,"I will NEVER go to this salon again to get any service.  I have been a customer of this nail salon for over a year.  Last week I called to schedule an appointment.  After waiting 20 minutes with feet soaking & water now cold-I asked how much longer it would be.  The lady beside me said she would be doing my pedi & it would only be a few more minutes.  I understand a delay, but what's the point of making an appt. if you wait that long?  Once she began my pedicure she seemed to be rushing.  I have 3 places on my feet where she rubbed with the pumice so hard that she burned skin off like an abrasion.  This was on Sat, today is Monday & it still hurts & has not healed.  I will find a new salon.  Wish I knew the ladies name & I would post this!!!  I told her it was hurting so she stopped rubbing so damn hard.  After she painted my toes, she put antiseptic on the worst burn-that only made it burn more!!!  Terrible service...unsatisfied"
DpwR9r16eiMec0BMALlAWw,"Fancy Nails is a great place to go when you are in a rush and need your nails done.  Firstly when you walk in they assist you right away, and soon enough your in your seat.  Let's say you got gels they would check every coat before putting it in the light. And they turn out perfect!  They also have a great coffee machine and water.  The people are super nice and great at what they do. It is also a very clean shop which has super comfy chairs washed supplies and the nicest polishes. So be sure to go to Fancy Nails, the nicest and neatest nail salon on earth!"
T8Y-sDeLHhoKFWBEMob1VQ,"Very disappointed with the pedicure I received. It was extremely rushed and lacked the sentiment of pampering yourself and relaxing. It was not meticulously done and there was nail polish left on my skin. I  can definitely do a better job myself. 

In addition to that, the nail technician cut my big toenail at an angle to the inside on each side of the nail, and it looks absolutely ridiculous. It was only that one nail so my overall pedicure is inconsistent. I brought it to her attention even though there was nothing she could do to change it and she brushed it off and said that's how it's done."
mpjVk2W8d3QXbmSnkNXrGQ,Overall great experience Everytime I have been in here. Weekends get slammed so if you want a longer massage and more time spent then you need to go in during the week. Very consistent in here as far as cleanliness and service. Always a great idea to call ahead and let them know you are coming to make sure there isn't a wait.
w0ABMHww4KHCHUp0eh9zog,"I've been here four times and each time was relaxing. Its quiet, does great work, and I'm going back again next weekend."
UXNLOvawyTLHqF1g0cn66Q,Holly is amazing I've been seeing her for years. She always helps me with my ingrown toe nail and she does an amazing massage. She cares with much detail. Best massage chairs in town. Great owner. This is my monthly stop !! :)
Yvb0sza8E0Tu9PbfMp_teQ,"I'm normally not a girly girl so nail salons don't really interests me but I was on vacation with my chica and decided what the hell, why not? So this review is from not your typical girl who gets their nails done routinely. I probably do it once every few years lol. Upon arrival, this nail salon looks very fancy and clean. Their tools I think are packaged and their prices are pretty standard. This place is also the 1st time in my life to get my nails done by a guy 0.0
I think the techs there are nice and friendly and they explained to me any questions I had like what is difference between gel manicure and regular ones. I believe there is a pretty big selection of colors to choose. Since I'm not an expert, check out my pics and see for yourself! :)

Also, they provide free coffee and candy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because my legs became a mosquito buffet but it's not their fault and it's pretty cool there with ceiling fans turned on."
L6uaksyM01k0HR7oVOaN3A,"Very nice girls, clean salon and quick service. 
If you pay with cash, you get a 5% discount. If you pay with debit, you can't add a tip to the charge, so be sure to bring cash. 
 I counted 17 people working today, very busy on the weekend, I dropped in with no appointment and got right in, 1 hour later, fresh mani/pedi in Lincoln Park After Dark (my favorite color). 
Go here!"
8X8KUOSLhzoqhgDN90-Dxw,"I've been to this salon twice. The first time was great and I was very happy with my gel manicure that lasted a very long time. The second time I came in and it was horrible!!!! I asked for a full set of acrylics. I got seated with the male tech. At first he was very nice and then when I asked for them to be a certain length he told me no and that that was ugly! I was so offended! I asked him again to go shorter and he refused. I finally picked a color and he did a horrible job. The color came out so streaky. I left and my nails looked horrible. My cuticles were still a mess, the lengths were all uneven and the polish sucked. I'm never going here again!!!!"
uuXUDGO5kM1FtGx4FI0ZWg,"Went on a whim while running errands and I was helped right away. The salon was very clean and the chairs comfy. The staff was friendly and though it was busy it was fairly quiet so I felt I could relax. basic mani/pedi for $34, not too bad! Will be visiting again!"
Os9pnsmw71rCWgToKKQGXg,"Terrible!! This was my first and my last time coming here. I came for a relaxing pedicure and dip powder manicure. I sat for my pedicure in between 2 ladies who were already well into their pedicures yet mine was done way before theirs. How is this possible when I got the same services they did? I asked them what pedicure they got and it was the same as me. Maybe because a guy was doing mine and he seemed to hate his job.  Hm... mine lasted about 15 minutes their pedicures lasted at least 30 - 40 if not more. Then I sit for my powder manicure. It was so bad I had the girl remove it. It took her 3 times of soaking my nails with the foil to get the gel off, that's how thick and awful it was. As I leave they charge me for my pedicure, ok fine, yes I got a pedicure, here's the kicker, she charges me $10 for a cuticle trim!! Are you serious? I left and immediately called my bank to dispute the charge. Worst customer service ever!!"
NGfWerOWmAW32Mo95qeWCQ,My manicure was sub par and the owner was rude. He refused my Amex card only after seeing that I had other cards in my wallet. As if that wasn't enough he was rude about it claiming they charge him too many fees. I will not return.
HZGqeD16bQfkGJYNZYQRRw,"This place is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  I did not have an appointment, but they got me in right away.  I had a full mani-pedi and an absolutely thrilled with the results.  I believe it was Jessica and David who helped me and they were both friendly as can be.  Hannah also was great.  I definitely recommend this place!!"
yu2KZdzMnEo0wGdhZYDzQQ,"Love this salon. Kim is very friendly and did a really nice job on my mani and pedi. The owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. The place is very very clean. I will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?"
H43aPUwEWxNZoitrUQzb6A,"Lovely ambiance
Attentive staff
Reasonable prices
They use disposable liners for their foot spas, which lessen the risk of catching bacterial infection.
Everyone is great, my favorite is Lynn. She is super talented!"
hsTbfMqB2FCSXARx7i7Jcg,"Needed a new nail place closer to my house so went here on a whim. I went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. Pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. My only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after I got home I noticed one if my toes was smeared. Luckily I brought my own polish so I could touch it up. I will be going here again."
Li_u03721rnB2YpK26tERQ,"Just found this little gem! 

We both had fabulous paraffin spa pedicures with hot stone massage. Very nice!!!

Hanna did a fabulous job on my powder mani! 

Everyone was super personable and the shop is beautiful and spotlessly clean... they are opening the new shop in four weeks and the pictures David showed us are OVER THE TOP!!!

We will definitely be back... this is our new spot!"
U-pppHSGa5pJ57okTl8Mow,"Love this nail salon! They are clean, friendly and my mani/pedis always look awesome. I even took my 5 year old niece last time and they were so great with her!  Don't forget to bring cash!"
Qo6pq2VH8RaxdmAXeLSMpQ,"I've been going to Fancy Nails since I moved to PHX in July of last year based on the Yelp* reviews and have never been disappointed.  This is the first salon I have been to in a long time where I don't have a specific technician work on my nails.  Every person in the salon does a great job.  I am fortunate to be out of work before 3pm during the week so I can get to Fancy Nails by about 3:15...I've never had to wait for a service when I arrive around that time.  I have been on weekends and it does get busy, so I'd recommend you make an appointment.  The salon stocks OPI shellac/gel polish in addition to some other brands I don't recognize. A gel manicure costs $25. For all of my pedicure people, Fancy Nails uses disposable pedi tub inserts so no worries about someone else's foot funk touching your tootsies (big plus)!  They have a few options for pedicures, so ask to see the menu before you start.  They also offer waxing services and tanning as well but I can't comment on them since I've never used them.
The salon is clean, well stocked, and everyone is always professional and courteous.  There are plenty of other nail salons closer to where I live but I choose to come to Fancy Nails.  They're everything I was looking for in a nail salon!"
ZrVQz1SKMfRAu86SlpMblQ,Thank you yelpers!! I found also found this place to be awesome!! Clean and lots of gel colors and glitter to choose from. Ill be back there for sure!!
eK2OOv1r5Zua5e43rbWmlQ,This was my 1st time at Fancy. I took a chance coming in on a friday w/o an appt but was greeted and seated right away. I met Hannah and she did a gel manicure. Very sweet and friendly. She was quick and did a great job. Another girl did my pedi and I was happy with that as well. The place was nice looking and clean and I liked the service. Prices were fair and I will def be back!
7f7k1eIdqjdB9c-JgFPLqg,"Had an appointment at 4:30. Hit bad traffic and called to say we would be 5-10 minutes late. Got there and it was not as if anyone had just been seated -- they didn't skip a beat with getting folks in prior. So, we had to wait. No one looked up and acknowledged us. Waited until 5:00, when we were finally acknowledged and we had to mention the appointment time that has long passed.

My daughter asked for shorter nails twice and nail tech did not listen. 5:45 and still here. Frustrating.

Tips: 

1. Honor appointments. 
2. Greet customers as they walk in. 
3. Techs need to listen to their customers and also consider their age. My daughter is barely 14, and asked for shorter nails but did not get what she asked for.

N-_MXQNFdaKAD7M0tnWtRQ,Best nail salon I've been to in the Valley. I never have to wait. I don't ask for anyone in particular because every person who has done my nails has been fabulous. The polish lasts for longer than any salon I've been to. Love this place!!
rDVCSa019LijFvOT41-KrQ,"This is my go-to spot for mani-pedi's and brow waxing. They do a bang-up job on my poor feet because it takes a lot to get those pups looking good. I have never made an appointment but never had to wait more that 3-5 minutes to be assigned a nail tech. 
They recently got new massage chairs that don't grind your bones or shake you to death like some chairs do. Also, this is one of the best places I have been for a brow wax. My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here. I don't know anyone by name but the employees are all very nice and skilled at what they do. Oh, and they are typically $5 cheaper than anywhere else I have been for pedicures!"
ub-bL39WA5xrnWcXW8yNBQ,Got a fill here about three weeks ago and my nails still look great!! Hannah did a great job and I will be back for sure!!!
IZbcEBVo65n72tCbsPXmfw,"This place is worth every penny, everyone is friendly and professional and they do great work every time, consistency is everything! I live an hour from this place and it always puts a smile on my face walking out."
HrzzQj0KfR_MI68flznBLg,"Amazing place downtown Oakville that makes you feel very welcome and has a downtown Toronto feel.  It's open a bit later than other places in Oakville therefore it's great for the night owl crowd. I've been there at least 3 times and there is usually some party going on.  Later in the evening they play music and have the most interesting Japanese Anime or Sumo wrestling on a big screen.  
The food is authentic and high quality.  Their rolls are amazing.  
But what makes this restaurant such a hit is the personal staff and bartenders who make everyone feel like a regular.  They greet everyone in Japanese.  I'll be back!"
qIANnEo-oBuDld5xTYEUVg,"My GF and I ate at Fin's on Saturday night Sept 21, 2013.  We had the chef's special tasting box which had 9 different items. The honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best.  There were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. There was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo.  The tuna was tasteless. Etc. In addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. It is simply not a good restaurant and I would not return."
xkVmcvD1A2qAMG75fC-miQ,"What a gem! I'm so happy I wandered into FIn! 

Since moving to Oakville I've been searching for as many Toronto-esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! I've found a few great places there, but no food (especially Asian) has actually been that great - until Fin! 

I went here on a Sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 PM. We were greeted in Japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server. 

Food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of Izakaya in Oakville, I wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank. 

Personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the Eastern Style Caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!).

Overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. I couldn't recommend Fin enough to those starved for a bit of Asian food in Oakville!

Disclaimer: If you're from Toronto and eat Izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!"
jXEDMeVE-UVzT1EKhrpt_A,"warning. !!!!!!   This is not the same fin as before sold to new owner !   Super dry pull pork rice burger and stale sashimi salad and  gone bad chicken skewers were the 3 dishes ordered.    I gave 15% tip that the owner dared to ask for such food and service, smiled back at the owners and said ""see you next time"" NOT!"
v2iNPLPlTLhkXjTwVnrplg,"Way too expensive for what you get. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place was not worth it. Was recommended by a friend after telling her how much I loved Guu but I definitely can't listen to her anymore! 

It's a nice looking place and the service was good as well, but the food comes first and it definitely was lacking. Sashimi was on par with AYCE places, not what you expect when you pay 40 bucks for 16 pieces. 

Overall, not pleased with my food experience."
JaAyQKuuxp1OOD-VQJEmSQ,"Exceeded expectations. Ate early around 6.15 pm so was fairly quiet...2 others. Strangely asked if we had reservations...interesting! 
Sauvignon Blanc from Chile was good and can be recommended. Cucumber Addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at $1.50 each. Shichimi duck salad also very good.  At $76 before HST & tip about right for the quality. Pleasant staff....will go again!"
u2n01D6o8TG9WLn2XODg6Q,"Fairly new establishment on the Lakeshore strip in downtown Oakville.  A good thing to see with all the For Lease signs that have been cropping up lately.

If someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  I'll assume it is a greeting.  The friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  The Izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  Hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  Pretty much a tapas menu.

After perusing the Sake menu, my wife and I settled on some Sapporo, mine in the bath-sized glass.  It wasn't that the Sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, I have limited experience with the Gekkeikan brand and I just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz, $15-30 sake that I may or may not like.  Maybe if I'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course I would have considered.

Any way, food:

In absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  A little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.  

Started with the Cucumber Addiction - sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  A great clean-tasting starter.  All orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.

The Pork Rib Kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  This was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.

The Soy Bean Cream Crab Croquette is a mouthful.  Resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.

The Tuna Carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  A little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.

The Deep Fried Prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.

As the evening progresses, more and more residents of Oakville filter in.  There is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  Conversations can be heard from basically every table.  The fake-chested table were amazed when Barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  A quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  Yaaaaay.

This is where service fell apart.  We had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  But with all the air-kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15-20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  Another 20 minutes later and the special of the night Cod we'd ordered arrived.  It was incredible and naturally buttery.  Any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.


Food for Thought:  if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7:30.  And the Blowtorch Mackerel?  It may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  Maybe its just me and my wacky palette.

Hopefully the ""trendiness"" wears off in the passing months.  The food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  It is the clientelle that I could do without."
a35yUa4tESbETOIq-28ozg,Demi Colored my Hair yesterday and WOW! It's just what i wanted. I have been looking to do a soft ombre and she did it to perfection. I was bleach blond when i came in and left with a more natural looking blond!
-mGcy0fmQ8INB5Swv9MteA,Finally a person who can cut my hair the way I like it.  Anthony cut my hair and Demi did my color ...  always comes out perfect!!  I would recommend Theory Hair Design to anyone looking for a great cut.  Thanks!!!
NsR2NAJbW7tPQLfgNV9ZtQ,"I've known Demi since we were but wee lasses. I know for a FACT that she is one of the most passionate people I have ever met. She does hairdressing because it is her true passion. Even when we were down in the dumps she pursued her career energeticly and industriously. Not for money, leisure, or narcissism. She is extremely talented and near obsessed with what she does. It's a rare thing to find someone who loves what they do. Needless to say, she is an excellent colorist. She loves to try anything fun, new, and exciting (even though she tugs on my tender head ;) ) 

Anthony is also incredibly talented. As a former T&G instructor he knows what he's doing. He is extremely precise and meticulous when it comes to his work. It's not just a hair cut to Ant, it's art, and he wants you to feel exhilarated when you leave. Even if I say I'm going home to drink beer he'll spend and extra 20 minutes playing with my hair to make it look fantastic.

I love you guys, keep up the good work xoxoxoxxxo"
LvrDkNEI-nKeWvnK-NfMOA,"I've been seeing Anthony for 12 years or so and have followed him and Demi from Toni and Guy to here. I can't say enough about their skills - they're the only people I trust with my hair. I have dark brown hair that many people have failed to lighten to blonde without it turning a hideous shade of orange and/or getting severely damaged. Demi has not only saved my hair from damage, but always takes my hair to the perfect shade of blonde. Before seeing them, I was told by someone at Regis that it wasn't possible for me to be blonde. Here I am, 12 years later, blonder than ever  Thank you Demi and Anthony for saving my hair. They're an amazing team!"
efsrTAKWTQJePKS8t7-WBw,Amazing team!   Great hair by Demi and Anthony .  I would Highly recommend for great color and cut...
f-bF8GvXvzjYAdG1cXmW0Q,"My fiance and I really liked this place. Huge step up from Stonepepper Grill. Our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point. Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?"
Z7wgXp98wYB57QdRY3HQ3w,"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. 
A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! 
Well with it."
-k0u6krCe0vkJL-RKlEMtw,"Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. 
We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. 
The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+
The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B
Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a ""back-of-the-throat"" heat which is perfect. So: ""A"" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! 
Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. 
I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu."
FzdhTetM0a7teVVtrjuNKg,"The wine selection was limited but of good quality.
The appetizer Arancini were good but seemed to just be a little bland the tomato sauce helped but it too needed more garlic.
My salad had too much vinegar and was drowning in it. 
The seafood Rollitini was ok but under seasoned.
The strawberry mascarpone cake, basically tiramisu with strawberries instead of chocolate, was just good not great. 

Service was ok but given the lack of a crowd should it should have been better.

It was not the best but far better than a chain store.
Would I go back probably yes at least one more time.

Suggestions to the owner.
1. Stop seasoning for old white people or at least offer to kick it up
2. Go to a team waiting model to give more attention to customers. 
3. Make us customers feel special not by cupon for free wine but giving a shit, talk to us treat us like we are honored guests.
4. Keep the seasonal menu going. 
5. Offer old fart seating at 4:00 to 5:00 ""give cupon for buy one pay 1/2 price for second "" you can offer the bland ""Special "" then."
XrKFPwrBPOwx8duWDLHFrg,"My husband and I went to Pazzo's for dinner during restaurant week.  We were both disappointed with our entrees.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  We both loved the lobster bisque.  My husband's crab ravioli was not warm.  My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat.  My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner."
C0B5VXECVGinXiTB7qWAJw,"We loved our experience here tonight.  Kim was our waitress and she was great.  Our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat.  I also have Celiac's disease, so no gluten for me.  Our meals came out just right, they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat.  You have now become one of our new favorite restaurants."
BP2mCfBp__gQESuDUNEXzg,"This restaurant looks lovely. There are beautiful paintings on the walls. The tables are set nicely. You are greeted kindly. The servers are very nice. The decor/environment and the service is the only reason I can give one star.  It was all downhill after that. 
I say all the time that of you can't get the basics right you can't get anything beyond the basics right. So we ordered two basic dishes-fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti & Meatballs. We chose to skip appetizers but a family style salad was brought to out table. It included a few cucumbers, a few grape tomatoes, some purple onions and a few croutons. There salad was cold but there was nothing memorable about it. We were also served 2 slices of bread. Again, nothing that stood out. 
The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our salad. It was awkward. When we went to eat our entrees they were room temperature. The meatballs were over cooked, dry, and didn't seem to have any seasoning. The spaghetti sauce tasted like tomatoes and not much else. I was extremely disappointed. I also tasted the fettuccine. It too lacked flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were inconsistent. Some were cooked to the correct consistency but some were hard. 
We skipped dessert because we didn't want to take the chance of eating anything else that lacked flavor. 
It's safe to say that there won't be a second visit."
0mx2az90kwNHaQLPtK8VDQ,"Great food!  Thoroughly impressed with bolognese, manicotti, and veal.  Meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Service needs tightened up, but they're still new."
GCf-MGbzQKNtqulgtpff3w,"Overpriced and flavroless.  This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.

The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.  

I had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.

My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.

Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.

I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick."
qGBVKSilE8S6oNqEZcOKIw,"The perfect word for this place is: bland. 

I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland.

Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland. 

On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!"
SJ-Kz-0E2-J814AczzWQ2w,"I can't comment on the food here because we didn't get that far. We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food."
we0UPFb8-YCdO3031Q6ZqQ,"Save your $22+/ plate & take yourself over to Giant Eagle's Café. 

It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.

The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. 

The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door."
9LkhocX36Lq_vlH3N-Bp4w,"I don't understand the 2 star reviews. Lunch today was very good, especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb."
OVYO5UZmnPIE_1vIFljokg,The wedding soup was so good! After eating that I was hopeful that the reviews on here weren't accurate... I'm sorry to say that they are true! I would come back for the soup but wouldn't eat dinner here again. We came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor.
9xhE5oSnN73ynKHc3nC6Bw,I completely agree with Kimberly said. BLAND CITY!!!  Hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers. But I doubt it.
DXegHspbOy3oWnQyEyj3iA,"So far all the reviews have nailed it- flavorless and cold food. Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a ""family style"" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?
I'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the ""lightly breaded"" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be ""diablo"" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..

We were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long."
CWY2Taq2YxKLAydGJ4U-7Q,"First time at this restaurant for my birthday dinner which was less than memorable. Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. ""Hi, just two of you?""not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back"
9O3ET_tLiuBfPbV4UF9zdQ,"My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table.

A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made.

Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value."
iBVABFfC5Yr0vvt6e7t4BA,"We had a great experience for dinner a few days ago! The service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu. I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination. From our zucchini appitizer, family style salad, entrees and wine, everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. The courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm,remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes. We will be back!"
ss4x7yFbFKIkAjnhnswBRQ,"The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign. 
But still wanted to give it a try. 
No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. 
My menu was dirty.
My silverware was dirty.
Glasses spotty. 
Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....?
Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. 
These little details could easily be fixed."
0glKaP0H84XJxCORugfbxg,"The worst dining experience I have ever had.  The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  

It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks.  When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before.  Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef).  He basically ignored them.

There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out.  At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks.  Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks.  Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves.  A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was.  We had no signs of him until we had to search for him.  

This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty.   I can't imagine it will be open long.  If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills."
Kb9xyEn9W2A1GMDsxF1xmA,"I really don't have too much to say other than the fact that I sent my food back and decided to just grab something to eat somewhere else.  Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up.  Dinner was bland and not even italian food...

Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right?  Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley.  The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better. 

Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75  For ketel one and some vermouth.  WOW.   There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews."
A10kO8mkZgORSlC3R-kUbQ,"The food is very good. 
But...... Bartender charged for a double. Should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00. When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!! They are sneaky and when they get caught, they are unapologetic."
M57psk3w8Tykb9nrbQ7bPA,"If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.

I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good.

A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered.

They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts. 

AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there."
5E6r13MMn3HLIsTZU-28dw,"Review is based on service and bar only - did not order food. 

Place was empty on Friday night. First warning sign.  My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign. 

We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!"
rP1fOEMJZTUgJ5V8vAvTYA,"You're not going to find Nihari and Biryani at this spot. It's American food made with a ""desi"" twist. 

Stepping into this place, it's an enigma wrapped in an enigma. Sholay isn't heavily advertised in your face so you don't know what to expect. 

The restaurant name brings memories of the legendary movie and elite characters. Come on. Don't tell me you can't hear Amjad Khan's voice :) 

Enough of me being Basanti . The place has: a large poster of Shah Rukh Khan, a pic of the Dalai Lama , and generic scenery pics. As you walk in you are promptly greeted by two American white people. The instinct as a desi is to run away but please resist this urge. 

You find out the staff, are owners and chefs who love desi food. The ""white dude"" who is their head chef, couldn't be more ""desi"" when it comes to spices and food. 

Loved the chicken wings and chicken kabob here. 

Only con: they are only open till 7pm."
iafwT1fvb5QQ-fqz7y7bQg,"So here's the thing. This isn't an Indian restaurant. No matter how you spin it. 

The ""naan"" is actually pita. The kind you buy in stores. There are three or four Indian curries on the menu. 
We got the chicken curry. The guy (there was only one person there, to cook and work the counter, but they weren't busy, so hey) said it was really good. If you're desi, you know what shan and all the boxed masalas taste like, and this definitely had that taste. 

Not saying it's a bad thing, but fresh masalas give a curry an aroma that this lacked. 

The chicken shish kabob was bland, except for the red chili powder added liberally on top, and it wasn't actual shish kabob. 

The best thing I had was the lamb burger. Oh my gosh. The lamb was super juicy. And the fries already had black pepper. Loved it. 

The place is super duper clean. Even the bathroom. 

Like I said, there was one person to cook, serve, answer calls, and take orders. He told us the others were out for a catering. 

This is in no way true Indian food. The shish kabobs aren't Indian shish kabobs, but rather Middle Eastern kabobs, the naan isn't true naan, either. 

Don't go to this place expecting awesome Indian food. But it is a decent place to go for a burger or the pizza."
k0pUou-q-TFAV0oIvT_oPg,"Not sure why my lamb kabob meal took so long to be ready, but I overheard something about the rice still cooking, and this was at peak lunch hour (noon)! My only complaint (almost 20 minutes for one to-go order with only 2 or 3 other customers at the time) was the waiting, but the employees were nice and made sure to let me know that I wasn't forgotten.  The shish kabobs were tender and savory, and their balsamic vinaigrette for my salad was the best I've ever had!!!  The saffron rice was also delicious even though it appeared to be the item that was delaying my order.   I should've called ahead, but next time, I want to try their lamb burgers...  Limited menu but top quality ingredients, yummm!

3/12/14
I returned there after work to pick up my lamb burger and side salad to go.  The ground lamb meat was indeed tasty, but I was disappointed by the smallish size compared to the bun.  I'll stick with the kabobs and rice in the future.  I was told by the nice man behind the counter that they'll be expanding the Indian portion of the menu in a few months so here's hoping they add samosas!"
dBWviP3LipdHhdwbpMjiTw,"Their burgers are so juicy and flavorful. Also greatly priced, and did I mention the burgers! I only tried a beef burger but the chicken looked so good! Te service was great with friendly staff. Definitely must try again!"
e3IeKncWZa55LPadXaFyUw,"Fresh food... exotic flavors.  Their tag line says it all!  I ordered the beef kabob on the recommendation of Phil, the owner, and I was not disappointed at all.  The halal meat was moist and spiced just right... absolutely delicious!  The basmati rice was also spiced in a subtle way that complemented the meat.  He brought me a sample of the rice pudding, and it was very good, along with the mango yogurt smoothie, which would be a refreshing drink come the hot days of summer.  I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other items that other Yelpers have raved about!"
Q0Ngh3nFEiBnX4kng09ElQ,"The friendliest worker ever works here. I think he is the owner, or just a very friendly man. Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get free stuff. Last time it was dessert, the other time it was mango lassi. The food is good and decent pricing. Sure, it's not the most glamorous presentations, but it is good for someone who is very hungry.

This place just opened up like a 3 months ago, so they are pretty eager to get customers in."
VAuszSrcSOnnTz16-9Jadg,"I usually come to Afandi a lot and would have never noticed the Sholay restaurant sign if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I had heard about it through yelp but didn't expect to try it out anytime soon. 

I was taken back by the fact that the owner of the place was not Indian! He was VERY friendly though and so I give this place a 5 for customer service! After having asked if the meat was halal, the owner told us that everything was halal except for the beef pepperoni. I'm very grateful that he not only verbally stated it, but has it written down on the menu as well. 

We weren't really starving so we placed an order for halal wings & fries as well as the pizza naan (with chicken, cheese and pizza sauce). He asked us if we wanted him to make it spicy, and like most Indians and Pakistanis, OF COURSE we said yes. So he made added chillies as well. 

Fast forward to the food - the halal wings were GREAT. Spicy, but a little too breaded. My bf noticed this as well, and was the first one to point it out. The fries came out extremely salty, but I finished the majority of them anyways. The pizza naan was good! Especially if you like chicken keema! The chillies the owner added made it spicy and quite scrumptious. 

The best part of our trip to this place was definitely the MANGO LASSI. The owner gave us each a sample which led us to ordering one. The lassi was thick, unlike many other places you order a lassi, and you could taste the yogurt. YUM. 

The owner also gave us a sample of the rice pudding, but I wasn't that big of a fan. I'm not the biggest sugar addict but I just wasn't feeling it. 

I hope to come back for the lamb burger and the lassi next time! 

Overall, this isn't entirely ""Sholay"". If you are looking for Indian (as in""desi khana"") food, go elsewhere. If you are looking for American styled Indian food, this is your place."
2ri42IvMGvPDKZCVBhJmCQ,"First impression is that this place is very clean but a little confusing- you walk in and see a buffet-type set up, but it's not being utilized and looks like there's a lot of junk around the kitchen area. I was immediately greeted and handed a menu, which has American breakfast specialties on the front, and inside is a small kabob selection, naan pizzas, and burgers. Very odd combination of offerings.

Ordered the chicken kabob platter to go, and was offered a breaded chicken wing to sample while I waited- they are trying out new menu items. The wing was huge and mostly composed of breading, which is not what I'm looking for at all when I'm ordering wings. Flavor was okay, but the wing itself was just weird.

Got home with my food in a reasonable amount of time and it was nice and hot- the kabobs were delicious, and my BF snagged a few bites even after devouring his sandwich. The rice in particular was very good: I'm not one to rave about rice, but it was moist and flavorful, and had some white, some yellow, and some orange in it- likely a combination of white and saffron rice, with additional seasonings. The naan and salad were also fresh, and the portion was generous, and on par with the $10 total. Best part of the meal was the cilantro sauce for the kabobs- it was killer. Highly recommend, get it on anything."
lpx51CmKp0qnKunRi0LI0Q,"Absolutely #Loving this place is. Scottish Mussels w/garlic, shallots, cream wow! Pan fried cod w/ asparagus, languostinemushroom sauce on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes #ToDieFor #KidFriendly - so welcoming to kids even later night! Ps side salad so fresh and tasty lots of feta and the mushroom pate appetizer #FAbulous"
Ymuvr4CXsBLOtP0MeHorFg,"Went here for dinner with my mom on a one night stay in Edinburgh. We shared the mussels in shallots and cream sauce and they were delicious. Very generous portion. Had to ask for bread to sop up the sauce. 
For the main course I had the Roasted Seafood and my mother had the rump steak (can't remember the other name for it). Both were excellent. Steak was perfectly done and the seafood was fresh and plentiful. Definitely recommend it, just sorry this will likely be my only time there."
S-5sTPnzhFksk4AY09P65Q,"Popped in to meet a friend for lunch.  Looked very ordinary on the outside, but the food was top notch.   My husband had the best steak he's had this trip here.  Cooked perfectly and delicious!!  I had a seafood curry that was also fantastic. Friendly, helpful waitstaff.  Great experience."
iZC379_rhDxb4fs-a4XBSg,"Mouth is watering at the thought, this was the best meal I have had in a very long time, staff were pleasant enough. Muscles were huge, so tasty and very well cooked, the basket of bread was replaced a few times. Will be back soon :)"
naSqWo1iwIm_UNvRLmoFqA,"Altro ottimo ristorante situato a 20 metri dalla piazza Grassmarket,livello alto di cucina sia di pesce che di carne!
Ottime cozze e pesci arrosto,buonissime ostriche scozzesi e deliziose bistecche di angus!
Per concludere dolci ben fatti preparati da loro!!!!
Servizio gentilissimo curato e giovanile!
Saluti Luca!"
DgrPLxnT6DJyvhwLEJnrfg,"This place is really good, but a little pricy I think. Although they do have some drink specials and a pot of mussels for about 13-15 pounds. But once you start ordering appetizers or any of the other entrees, it can get pretty pricey pretty fast. I didn't think the mussels were anything out of the ordinary really -- and I was surprised to find cilantro all over mine (usually it's parsley when you order a shallot, butter, and white wine sauce). This wasn't on the menu so I had to try and pick the cilantro out. The one must-order here though I would say is the grilled scallops with butter appetizer. It's juicy, buttery, slightly sweet scallops on the shell -- and probably my favorite thing here."
txV-qcucLaZSESdUSJdQ5Q,"Perfekt, man kann draußen sitzen und das direkt am gut frequentierten Grassmarkt.
Lecker Fisch und Fleischgerichte, also rein mit dem Surf & Turf"
v6taWbXFF0a0r096qR3RNw,"I ordered mussels with ginger/lime sauce and they were the best I have ever eaten. For £12.50, the portion was huge (may be 30 or more) and the sauce was more like soup at the bottom. It was spicy and delicious."
UXYFVn5e_YoCU2mmxBglsQ,"it's been a while since I've posted anything to yelp - but I noticed a distinct lack of available info during my travels to Scotland and Ireland, so here goes

This place is located at the (end of the) Grassmarket in Edinburgh - from what the guide books tell me, it would have had a great view of all the hangings (puir man got hangit) that took place there.
The inside is modest but nice and aside from the somewhat crabbit (maybe German?) bartender, the service was just fine.  We split a bucket of mussels (shallot cream white wine sauce) and I had an 8oz ribeye - the husband had something weird like pasta.  The mussels were the best I've had in my life, truly amazing, and the steak, skinny little thing that it was, was delicious also.  The quality of the local beef and seafood spoke volumes - no extravagant preparations or sauces required.

Highly recommend."
lcyKTYsFF8311U4reDlDsQ,"I went to The Mussel and Steak Bar after a date at the nearby BrewDog. The date was going well (oh la la) so he suggested stopping by this place for dinner. It was a Friday around 730 and we didn't have reservations, but we were able to be seated for a table for two. The manager was cheeky and ribbed my date a little bit for pretending to look in the reservation book to pretend to be someone else, which was very amusing. We were able to sit upstairs and I thought the place had lovely ambience. 

We started with some fried goat cheese balls and garlic grilled mussels. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of mussels but I thought ""When in Rome!"" and tried them. They were really tasty, but I'm not sure garlic was the best date choice! Anyway, for my main I had a special fried plaice with black pudding mash that was extremely tasty. My date had a steak that he enjoyed. Topped off with a nice glass of house white and I was a happy camper. I will definitely come back to The Mussel and Steak for another nice dinner in the future when I'm in the area, which of course I will be because I do love BrewDog..."
F75u7vq1dndChBrAX_eA2g,"We had a light dinner here, it was fantastic! Fresh seafood at it's finest. Started out with Arran Smoked Salmon with Potato Scones, Crème Fraîche and Chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. We also split a kg of the Scottish Mussels, we chose Shallots, White Wine, Garlic & Cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. This was probably one of the best mussels pots I've had. 

Call and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the Bow Bar to pass the time). If you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of Grassmarket."
K2NHGrPLPncaemIs43q-ng,"The best surf and turf I have ever had. 

I stumbled upon this place by accident during a day trip to Edinburgh. It was during Scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside - a rare treat in our climate. We were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe. 

Now to the food. Me and my dad both opted for the same thing - the surf and turf. This consists of a Rib Eye Steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. Being a big fan of Asian flavours I opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. We also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein.

When the dish arrived it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak (medium-rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood - not many things could look so appealing. All the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the Corona with lime just added to an amazing meal.

Next time I'm in Edinburgh I will definitely be making a return here (I hope the heatwave will too)."
fAX6RzUALYAp5mgN5VSAfQ,"I went there for a casual lunch date with my SO. It is lovely. They have a pretty reasonable lunch and even dinner deal if you want to fine dine on a budget. 

I had the steak and it was great! So good and nicely flavored and cooked just right. The mussels are great! They have a Thai inspired flavor which is not bad if you want something different. 

I do recommend getting the French fries fries in beef jus. It's good and so much better than their plain potatoes."
17bT7TRCa5_BpPDBvoue9A,"I'd recommend any seafood lover to go to the Mussels and Steaks Bar.  Excellent food, great service and located in a bustling part of town. The decor is basic but the great tasting fresh food and friendly service more then made up for it.  

All the food was fresh, vibrant and flavorful.  Our group tried the seafood platter, the special lobster dish, curry mussels and the surf and turf combinations.  No one had a complaint about any of the dishes.  The best part was the double fried chips in drippings."
JpSrnl1OYhiX2iKKZ5CGLg,Heerlijk gegeten. In eerste instantie lijkt het wat klein maar boven zijn ook nog plaatsen. Het vlees is heerlijk en de mosselen ook. De wijnkaart is mooi en compleet en zelfs de whisky liefhebber kan hier uit de voeten. Een aanrader.
cqDIsJfwh50sTSyW6ZBxJQ,"This is a gem in an otherwise touristy Grassmarket. This place has fantastic food, Oysters, Fish, Steak, and plenty of other options. But the specialty has to be the mussels. Choose a mussel pot and have it in any of five ways to suit your palate and mood, just take your pick. Depending on how hungry you are choose a full three course, or share a divine starter and dessert. All this with great service, good price and fresh atmosphere."
VTylazw9aG4M7IQbGMzz_g,"Fantastic seafood, with a wide menu selection. Staff are friendly, eager to please and not afraid to make an honest recommendation or suggestion. The restaurant is generally busy, mostly down to it's great reputation and location. The prices are reasonable given the quality and quantity. Also great at dealing with larger groups of dinners so a good place to book a special family meal"
U7wIblaF05QkXCKbGVIfOg,"I come here. A lot. Either with my mum or with friends (usually to celebrate a birthday) this has become a personal favourite eating place. 

Firstly, it does good food- whether you are into seafood or meat. You get to watch your food being cooked on a screen (which is slightly odd) and I love the layout of the ground floor- quite modern without over doing it. Look out for the fun facts about mussels in the toilets.

The service has always been super friendly at this place. Being in such a prime location I was expecting shocking prices but I was pleasantly surprised. They have amazing lunch deals and I have never walked out of this place hungry.

Sadly they only have one vegetarian option as far as mains courses go. Also, in the winter the upstairs floor tends to get really warm. 

Aside of these hitches Mussels and Steak Bar is a good standard for me."
SpdjTAUq_AgsuP9ZuMi8bA,"Was expecting a lot from this place based on the reviews, but honestly we didnt love it. It was just OK. Service was quick and friendly. They were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. Both the seafood and steak were good quality, but I guess they were just a bit boring. 

Boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. Although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium-rare) which was good. The queen scallop starter was OK, but the scallops were quite small and over-salted. Mussels were pretty good. 

Overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to Grassmarket on a regular basis."
jaH1ZzTCgPAUZ5ktpcNBfA,AMAZING! Went at tea time on Monday night and couldnt have left fuller or happier :) Waiting staff are very very attentive and friendly. I had smoked salmon salad for starters and mussels in white wine and garlic for main and it was superb. It is a wee bit more expensive than other places but I would say its definately worth it. Food served very fast as well.
t0f4p1JLscASG2LZD13MCA,"Everybody in my family likes something different. My Dad likes Italian, my Mum French, myself Indian and my sister Chinese. The problems it causes when we each want our restaurant to provide something different. As a comprimise, we often decide that a restaurant serving British food is the best option - but then its time for the real battle to begin. Light and fresh sea food or good and hearty steaks?

It seems then that I should introduce them to Mussels and Steak Bar - which, as you would expect, serves Mussels and Steak.

Its no secret in the restaurant that the produce is local (or at least Scottish) and the ingenious menu combines seafood and heavy meats in brilliantly tasty ways. The sauces used are outstanding, if a bit 'out there' and incredably mouthwatering (In fact my mouth is watering as I type).

The restaurant itself is simple and practicle - and despite the annoying big screen TV's - has a seaside town feel to it,matching the down to earth cooking style. The staff are friendly and helpful, while the bar offers a large range of drinks.

So there you have it, a restaurant which can cater for all appitites and in a mouthwateringly excellent way."
Aqur97gqGmgSTP92QQ4W6w,"We were in for the Edinburgh Festival and saw our favorite tapas place replaced by Mussels and Steak. 

The atmosphere looked a little cold and modern but the menu was interesting. 

In a word, the mussels were terrific! We tried the bacon and cream. Plump mussels, huge pot, delicious.

Our scallop starter was equally good. The steak was fine but next time we are just doing mussels. This is really their thing.

Not five stars as they just opened (second location) and fumbled a bit with forgetfulness and delays.

The staff and owner were very friendly and apologetic. Highly recommended
 ."
BBUGwYfheR4YJL_77_o55A,"I must say the name of this restaurant is straight to the point and those two things are exactly what my friend and I ordered. The steak was alright, I've definitely had better, but I will say that the mussels were pretty damn good. Very flavorful and piping hot when they arrived at the table. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Belgium, but they definitely weren't bad, and there was also plenty to share for two people. The restaurant itself isn't all that fancy but their service is. They make sure you're taken care of throughout the entire meal. 

Oh, you must get the Banoffee Pie. What's better than Banana + Toffee + Graham Cracker Crust. Absolutely nothing. It's heaven in your mouth."
bIOQ7AOyi7BWGT_9buM0Zw,"I don't like mussels.  They are too strong and too fishy! Don't care for the smell and don't care for them in soups or stews.  Until now I would have told you that I'd rather eat rattlesnake.  Appearantly in Scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels.

We stopped in at the Mussel and Steak Bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10:30 Tattoo.  Our travel mate ordered the mussel starter.  It arrived with green sauce on it.  OMG, it smelled amazing.  So much so that I had to taste it.  The little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them.  It is such a great combination!

I had the surf and turf for dinner.  The mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as I ordered it. All four of us agreed that our meals were delightful.  The price was not out of line.  Service was spot on."
gYeiI_21LzFWidjHbNkiyQ,"I went here recently for a colleague's leaving lunch. There were 8 of us in our group & it was quite busy. 

We ordered from the lunch menu - 1 course £7.95, 2 courses £9.95 or 3 courses £11.95.

Most of the group ordered starters & the haggis dish was the most popular. 

I saved myself for the 6oz rump steak which was awesome. The chips were chunky & crispy, just how I like them & the mushrooms were earthy & full of flavour. My steak was perfectly cooked, moist & melt in the mouth. 

A colleague had the seafood curry. It was full of enormous mussels & other fishy delights. It smelled amazing & he said it was the best fish curry he's had. The only problem being that it took so long to arrive he didn't have time to finish it before having to get back to work.

Unfortunately the service was slow and I we all had to skip dessert & coffee as we needed to get back to the office (despite being there over 90 mins).

A lovely lunch with great food & company. It was a shame the slow service meant it was a wee bit stressful. The front of house staff were lovely maybe they just need another pair of hands in the kitchen."
5gXLsbta81wMFknMKdDBwQ,"On our last day in Edinburgh, I still hadn't tried Haggis.  And I really wanted to try it.  The waitresses we excited to watch me try it for the first time, they were chatty but not overly.  They were attentive, but not overly.  I had a good time, but next time I'd like to take my time and order more and stay longer."
2pofOFx9JttlOFs4hUoT7A,"An excellent experience - all of the food was of a high quality, as was the service..

Whether it was scallops, mussels, oysters or plaice, the seafood was first class and as fresh as the sea itself.

Steaks were also delicious, both ribeye and sirloin.

The wine choices worked well with the food and the choice of whiskies suited our need to try something different. 

Staff were terrific. Attentive, friendly and showing real concern for our table.

We will be back."
lxNDA2vZqt7eZ0k1hg5hcg,"I went here for the langoustines, and they did not disappoint.  They were nicely cooked and flavored with garlic butter.  The main course of mussels came with at least 30, and they were delicious as well (we had the chili seasoning). Others in our group had steaks that were nicely cooked (medium rare) and tasty--great chips, too. Our waiter was a bit casual with the service, but the other wait staff picked up the slack.  Overall, it was an excellent Edinburgh meal, with ingredients that featured the best that Scotland has to offer."
h0S3VvpTFURIKAecNyE5tQ,Very easy to find. Seafood place with reasonable price. We enjoyed both the mussel and steak :)
V5RxjppLE-M_nFgIF2xFnw,"One of the best spots for seafood in Edinburgh, and one of my favorite restaurants in the world. 

Located just across the street from a longer strip of restaurants and pubs in the Grassmarket, it would be possible to pass the Mussels Steak Bar without giving it a second thought. That would be a huge mistake.

I've made about 12 trips here for lunch and dinner, and every time I've always been greeted by an unbelievably friendly waiter or waitress. They start you off with some of the best crusty bread and softest whipped butter you'll ever taste, and they are happy to replenish it many times over.

My favorite way to start a meal is with a kilo pot of their mussels, which are all ridiculously fresh and delicious, particularly with the white wine, shallots, garlic and cream sauce. Both the steaks and the seafood pasta (with loads of mussels, scallops, prawns, and calamari) are excellent main courses, and their fries with 'beef dripping' are some of the best I've ever tasted. Their wine list is not huge but offers good selection at reasonable prices. 

The meal can definitely run on the pricey end depending on the conversion rate (if you're an American) but I have never walked out of this place unsatisfied. Highly, highly recommended!"
mbTXVJxfZlgI5UAfEputjg,"Great steak, great mussels, and great cocktails. Fun vibe in a great neighborhood. Get the chips fried in beef drippings."
-kBwORytF9aJ2PPivv39Lw,"Service was excellent!! The server was very attentive & accommodating. No one rushed or hurried us out even though we were the last to leave that night. Make reservations in advance if possible. 
The Mussels were not bad although I had to order bread as it didn't come with bread. The scallops & bacon appetizer was a delicious combination. Yum! The Surf & Turf lobster tail & braised beef was my favorite entree and a big portion. The sirloin steak w/carrots & cauliflower was great. However, the mashed potatoes were not that flavorful. 
Dessert - the chocolate mouse was good but the chocolate hazelnut (special of the day) was amazing! Must order this if you get the chance."
Cj_Cu6xvzKgbViE1Btat8A,"Came for a late lunch and enjoyed great food, friendly service, and an overall excellent value. I recommend it."
EuItnAFcC7BvskhO4GEscg,"Our meal was stupendous! Got the surf and turf. Ribeye steak was juicy and cooked perfectly. The mussels were cooked in a whisky, bacon and cream sauce. OMG! Unbelievably delectable. Portion sizes were enormous. Smoked salmon duo for appetizer was just as good as the main course. Overall one of the best meals we had in Edinburgh."
IrchMqHAL3mZbp02GeDThg,Wow. This place was Sooooo good.  Oysters rib eye and cheesecake were all incredible. The side of mushrooms were also very good. The prices are great for what you get.
qcTJVZ5R_-Ef0_tKnPKneg,"Fantastic location but very small on the inside, can be a long wait.  The seafood was only slightly above average in freshness and quality, and small portions, so had to knock off one star."
N2YP16zgWMdueJ_3e2vTJg,"So you get mussels or you get steak.  We both got the steak.  It was our first day in Edinburgh and the restaurant was recommended by a friend.

Food was okay.  My steak wasn't all that flavorful and the chips were a tad bland as well.  Also, my food arrived to the table warm, not hot.  Y'all know how I feel about that.....

A little pricey but not really worth it.

Service was very good."
Zbzh9ihIEPJCX0QgEjyDag,"Wonderful steak, wonderful mussels, great value!


 A great place for meat and fish lovers like me - I highly recommend.

26Z04ZSvjBclBLxQ21WdAQ,"The other reviews are  surprising. The first surprise is that a reviewer is surprised to find that Scotland, the north part of Great Britain (a well known island), has decent seafood. The second, and more disturbing, is the complaint that a restaurant with the name ""Mussel and Steak Bar"" has a fairly short menu. One might have thought, nay expected, that the menu would be mainly ...

On a positive note, what I can say is that they provide first class food. What they say they do they do well. The steaks, in my experience, are meltingly tender. The chips (US: french fries) cooked in beef dripping are crisp and moreish.

The restaurant is good value because not a  morsel will be left on the plates."
ldoZRpriyacPFVkvtWqGGQ,Stopped for lunch and we weren't disappointed.   It was fantastic.  My wife had the mussel special and I had the hot seafood platter.  I watched them deliver a few of the Tomahawk specials and they looked incredible.  My only disappointment was that the hot seafood platter was mostly mussels and not very varied but still well done.   The outside look of this place does not represent the quality inside.  Service was great.
dW3MIOh9a1_ACWhcexIUtA,"Stumbled upon this gem. An easy wLk off the Royal mile and below the castle.
The mussels were tasty and the scallops were terrific.
The cost was reasonable and the service was excellent."
d9kdJMmc_wOBh9Kv-9GK3g,"Came here with family for dinner on a Saturday night. We booked in advance, but the place wasn't terribly busy in the end. The atmosphere is quite formal and a bit quiet, rather than bustling and busy. I went for the red curry mussels, as did my husband - my parents got the traditional with shallots and cream. The servers gave us the wrong mussel pots which took us a while to figure out, as all the sauce collected at the bottom and wasn't really coating the mussels, so we honestly couldn't tell whose was whose initially. We had to take some of the huge portion of mussels out and put them to the side, so we had space to use our spoons to coat the remaining mussels in sauce. Once we managed that though, the mussels were very tasty and fresh. The sauces were mild, but added a nice subtle flavour to the dish. Sides were decent but basic - slightly soggy fries, steamed seasonal vegetables, nothing terribly exciting. The price can't be beat though, at £14 for an enormous meal.

Not the most memorable of meals, but an enjoyable one. I think a loosening up of the atmosphere would go a long way."
Wm4TI3EnVaC35DQyZ2WBnQ,"Very tasty food, great beer and really friendly service!!"
HMRA6uHM6qT3dfcndY_a4Q,"I never fail to enjoy a good feed at the Mussel and Steak Bar. Pot of mussels with white wine and garlic sauce does the job perfectly. The ambience is pleasant, but it's better to sit downstairs as the upstairs bit feels a bit empty and lonely I think. 

Food is generally lovely. Staff are generally lovely. Place is generally lovely. Go!"
S9Ewi91NGNKdETXsnxzEgA,Pool tables were in good condition and so were the sticks. Went on a Sunday and was charged $16/hour. It was a good experience and atmosphere overall.
Vi1KHLU9RrRvK4zLIn1q0w,"In University every Monday was the night reserved for a couple of pints and a few games of pool. I still have fond memories of those nights spent with my house mates and when we get together now and then, someone always brings up a pool related story or joke.

Walking into Petrina's Taps and & Billiards for the first time recently, the similarities  to my old pool hall brought back old familiar memories of my University billiards nights. Everything from the sounds of laughter or someone racking up a new game, to the smell of the velvet table tops mixed with tap beer and mixed drinks. Even the dimly lit room seemed all to familiar. I loved it.

Arriving later in the evening, my friends and I were unsure how long we would be playing for and didn't know if we wanted to pay the hourly rate of $15/Hr (even though it was very reasonable). Upon expressing this to our server he recommended that we use the $1/game table. What a deal!! With the average game of pool taking about 5-15 minutes why wouldn't we explore this affordable option?!

Several libations later we had played 8 games over 2.5 hours, saving ourselves $37 by playing the $1 tables. We didn't even have this kind of deal when we were students!

Pool is not something I regularly play, however if I am ever in Ajax again with a hankering to play, I'll be sure to head back to Petrina's with a pocket full of change."
WH0x9lzFg7WJNNGBVbfnFg,"Definitely not the classiest joint in town... or maybe it is...?

The tables are old(er) but the felt is still in relatively good shape. Some of the cues have cracked tips but if you look, you can usually find one worth playing with. 

Monday and Tuesdays they have $5 pool from 6pm to 11pm (although I think that's gone up to $6 recently)... either way, you can't complain about that. 

They have a fully stocked bar and will make tea and coffee on request for those of us who don't drink. They also have a half decent menu with food that's prepared downstairs at Texas Burger (yum).  

You're pretty much in view of a TV wherever you are and they have a large projection TV in the lounge area allowing you to sit, eat and watch the game. 

I'm not saying it doesn't happen but I've never seen a rowdy crowd here and although I've been to better halls, this place is okay for a fun night out."
BLNZCBGFjnU_E17IKNuGuw,"Enrolling my 3 kids into their Sat morning Chinese Prog. The facility is clean and well organized. They  seems to focus on academics, kids are grouped by level and not age."
lisyLGyKSTUMqrX8QbHTIQ,"My child has attended this school for the last 9 months. Learning ABCs and math and chinese, playing outdoors and indoors.  The School has lots of different age students from when the child is potty trained to kids taking their SATs to adults learning Mandarin.  They even have water activities on weds and Fridays (weather permitting).  

I am happy to drop off my kid to school. My kid has learn how to speak basic Mandarin.  There are lots of non asian children in school. Most teachers are bilangual. Lots of mixed asian children too.  The school is very focus on safety.  You need to be buzzed in to get into the building. Each parents sign in and sign out during pick up and drop off.

We (including my mom who is a former teacher) checked out three different pre kindergarten for my child and felt this was the best one.  We are happy we choice this school."
d2kFz3Yl7QKK9j_RT6bhcg,"Dedicated staff and a variety of teaching methods have helped with my daughter learn a lot in a short time.  I wish we had gotten her in here sooner. The staff has always listened to our feedback. I feel the school provides exactly what they promise, and would keep her here full time if they went past Kindergarten."
NfdMfZXca4s7eGdCRAcCjA,I really like this school for my son . He learn a lot  here and he looks forward to come . The teachers are great and the rest of the staff . Thank you Las Vegas Chinese school
YVEC4ow3mkAoqq-ykPKY7g,"I don't normally write reviews, but this place is just no good. The principle Cathy Endy is rude, I don't think someone like her can run a children's school. My son went there for a little bit, he didn't learn anything! What a waste of money."
u_NHsrzEsyRuGCFgdzQSbQ,"My kids have attended to this school for two years. The staffs and teachers are really helpful, especially to bilingual students. All teachers are fluent in Chinese and English. The school creates a great environment for kids to communicate and learn Chinese is a fun way. Besides education, the school always pays attention to students safety too. I love this school!"
aniFV2XWCa4fvfCvnafUNA,"The wife and I wanted to modernize our home theater system and clean up the cluttered look.  We chose three businesses on the west side of town to start with.  Elite A/V was the only business that could be bothered to qualify us as customers and after about an hour of talking A/V with Carmine and Jeremy we had three quotes THAT DAY!

I needed to convert my old ""tube"" TV niche so I could hang the plasma on the wall.  During this remodel project Elite A/V sent a team out to pull some new wired networking runs and they were able to complete this task in one day.  A couple of return visits to patch up the holes and you can't tell they were ever here!  The price was very reasonable and the job was finished quickly (much quicker than I expected) and professionally.

We had asked Carmine to give us three quotes and a budget cap to work with and when Carmine told us we would have quotes same day I originally thought that was a bit optimistic since we met with them later in the afternoon...but sure enough after dinner I had quotes in my inbox.  This is the kind of service we received from Elite A/V over and over, when they said they were going to do something they did it and always on time.  We decided to go with Martin Logan Eloctrostats and a Marantz receiver to replace our aging equipment and I will say it is impressive, the warmth, depth, and clarity is hard to imagine until you hear it.  This was an A++ purchase at a reasonable price and we are one hundred percent satisfied.

We are looking forward to our continued relationship with Elite A/V as their customer service and quality of service was unmatched by others we talked to during our remodel project.

Five Stars from Robert and Stephanie"
--Ls9Tr7TcANq95nLgIBZw,"FRANK.......MY Hats off too Jeremy at Elite AV. Following a no show twice in 48 hrs. by one of his competiors. I had no choice but to grab the ball and run. I went on line and after about 15 min of reasearch I chose Elite AV. Within 45 min.  I had an Appointment set up for same day  installation. Wow was I lucky. Jeremy showed up right on time and 4 hrs later my install was completed. During the process there were recomendations made to meet my needs, I went with all sugestions. I must add not one recomendation was made that did not make financial sense to achieve my needs.He never tride to upsell me or his services. Thanks for the honesty. Jeremy and team will now service all of my  family and friends home theather/ security needs. Thanks young man...I wish you much sucess continue to do what your doing in the manner you are doing it dont loose focus, you cant miss. Frank...."
gfK2qPaEfBaip_LlikCqAg,"PLEASE use these guys!  This has been the best experience for us!  We found them on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) and from the very beginning they were on top of it.  They were fast, efficient, courteous, and clean.  But more importantly, they know what they are doing and are true experts in their field.  We shopped a few companies before choosing this one and on top of everything else, they beat the other companies price!  Very happy overall and will recommend them to everyone."
RZdcFaKqFHS3Ju2Cdqbkpw,"NO MORE DEAD SPOTS!  Thanks to Elite AV putting in an awesome Wi-Fi system in my house, every corner of my house has an awesome Wi-Fi signal that works perfect. It's just like having a Wi-Fi system in an office building but in my home!! so it's absolutely the best of the best in Wi-Fi and I couldn't be happier with what they've done!! Not to mention the install and set up that they installed in my closet looks amazing!! Truly an amazing installation it's not like that crappy job that the cable man does when they come to your house, by having Elite AV install your system your getting a  professional custom install with the cooling fan system and rack all bolted to my walls exactly what you want you're home ! So you can only imagine how happy my houses when every TV in my house is streaming videos movies music and have no problem at all thank you elite AV for everything that you've done!! I recommend anybody who's looking for professional courteous awesome installation with great working Wi-Fi to use Elite AV !!"
CEnTV3fys6X2pH2-2V-s-A,"I spent so much time reviewing projectors and screens that I never really thought about installation. I finally narrowed down my choice to Jeremy and his team and that turned out to be the best decision in the world! Jeremy came by to check out my loft and we brainstormed ideas for my home theater. He was very knowledgeable and left zero doubt in my mind that I'd picked the right company. Jeremy and his team got my projector ceiling mounted and my 110 inch screen up in no time. He threw in a video receiver and two ceiling mounted speakers to complete the perfect home theater for me and my family! He even installed a new outlet so I could hide the wires on my living room television when I asked last minute. That was icing on the cake that made a person like me who rarely writes, just reads reviews, make sure that I shared the experience I had with this company! A+ work"
bMm81UvmMj2dZFyU8BKhLw,"From the initial meeting for a detailed quote with Carmine to the install and set up of my system with Jeremy (brilliant young man) and team. The experience was pleasant, great attention to detail and absolutely no damage to my home. The mess that was inevitable with any A/V install was meticulously cleaned up by the team.  This company strives to be the best and will work with you regardless of your budget. I will stress however if you are looking for a superior system do not skimp with inferior components.

True professionals and will spend the extra time to make sure you are completely satisfied with your system and truly understand the operation of your new system and control before leaving. 

Definitely 5 stars, will definitely use this company again when the situation arises. And"
AXg9hbR6fMfktGbAa40wKg,"Thank you, Finally an audio / video specialist company you can trust and thats not creepy. I was't even planning on putting a home theater system for my house until i talked to Jeremy, who was highly recommended by a close friend. Long story short he stopped by my house we did a walk through together and he really took his time to explain the different possible options we had based on quality of the products and my budget. He wasn't pushy and made me feel real comfortable. Next day i received an amazingly priced estimate and decided i was going to do it. Him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours. What made my experience even better was the fact that he was more than willing to teach me how to use my brand new pioneer receiver. All and all they made my life a lot  more entertaining. I have to admit i did spent a bit more than i had initially planned but it was worth it. I will be calling them back for more stuff, highly A+++ recommended..."
AwLQrozoTx3YBKrVKX0w8Q,"I sent an email to Elite A/V LLC to see if they could give me an estimate to hook up a new blue ray, to an older home theater system and new tv.  They replied back to me within minutes saying it would probably be around $99.00 which I found acceptable and scheduled an appointment for the next day.  They arrived on time and explained that because the home theater system was so old they could not connect the new blue ray to it but could only connect it to the TV.   Since that was not a good option for me I declined and they were kind enough to not charge me for the service call.   I then thought about purchasing another home theater system but they suggested that I use the existing built in ceiling speakers.  I had originally not wanted to spend what I thought would be a lot of money to hook those up but after further discussions with Dylan I agreed this was the best route.   He was able to provide a receiver and sub-woofer for me or I could have went out and purchased my own.  I verified based on his quote and the cost was no more than what I would have paid at Best Buy.   We rescheduled for the next day for the install and again they were right on time.  Kevin and his partner came out and completed the installation in about 2  1/2 hours talking us through the whole process.  They had to cut a small hole in the back of the entertainment center so they could attach the wires which I was at first not crazy about but it was very small and behind a closed door so it was a non-issue.  The cost came to more than what I had intended to spend at the time but I am so glad that I went with their suggestion.  The sound is fantastic, I don't think we will ever go out to see movies again.  I would highly recommend Elite A/V LLC as I felt they were very honest in explaining our options and we did not feel pressured at all on the direction to go."
b_KUmSF-rpk0-ZR9BsO49A,"Very disappointed. Less than 6 months after installation and setup, the cameras can no longer be viewed away from home."
yVwIjyhF0a9Bhamt-vzOJQ,"I needed the surround system for my house set up.  Jeremy came in and evaluated the house.  He made suggestions.  Jeremy chose some great equipment that were the best bang for my buck.  He was willing to work around my schedule for everything.  Chris and Dillon came to install the equipment after the consultation.  They were ""somewhat"" professional.  No...they were great and easy to work with in the house.  They cleaned up after themselves and did a fantastic job.  Sometimes when strangers come into your house, it can become awkward.  In this case, we cracked jokes and were able to still maintain an efficient time frame.  They suggested some things for the future as well.  I would recommend them hands down for any work.  If all works out, I plan to use them for some automation."
YRH5SVwGe6GxQ2YYSSitTA,Jeremy and his company have always done fantastic work for me. Anything I dream up he can accomplish. I have used his company for several years and would never trust anyone else. He is the best!
ucGC4r_07btRNWjlBsD1hA,"I am as picky as they come for A/V ascetics and performance. Elite came and mounted my tv on then when we didn't like the height they changed it without hesitation. The most professional team. We got an A/V rack, custom remotes, and everything worked perfectly and it was top notch equipment. 

We had them come a second time and the same performance. We had all the A/V companies come out for the bid and they don't hold a candle to Elite. Jeremy & Dylan are the best."
vXzCly6VlAYtIg85wEzDXQ,Dylan and the rest of the team are true professionals. They are very knowledgeable and worked quick; they did three plasma tv/ receiver/ blu ray set-ups in one day (and one of those involved installing speakers into the ceiling via my attic crawl space). I'm very happy with the results.
jvqoSKiBgHj4wTeo2fKh-w,"Great experience!  Had 2 TVs and a sound bar installed.  Great quality work!  Jeremy, Dylan, and Chris are all very friendly and easy to work with.  Highly recommend them!"
EQB9tt7pb-AsI08StkvouQ,"I have worked with Jeremy at Elite A/V numerous times he is very particular clean and does excellent work. They do everything at 100%, never cut corners, very knowledgeable, polite, and honest. I recommend them to anyone!!"
j5Gr1iJYlx-v2J7YAJppPQ,"Just moved to town and my home theater system was still in moving boxes. 
I needed help and am very happy that I reached Jeremy at Elite. 
He arrived at the time promised and installed everything at a fair price. 
He and Dylan were more than professional and answered all by questions. 
When they were finished I was very pleased with my system and really noticed the improved sound with the suggestions that were made. 
I would not hesitate to recommend Jeremy and his team to any one who has a need for AV service."
6IpPwu8f0LnpwpP2ojb9zQ,"Chris and Jeremy are great. They installed a 4 camera system (with ability to run 8 total) in my home after my wife wouldn't stop nagging. The system is real nice. They installed two flush mount screens (about size of smaller computer monitor) in both my bedroom and family room area. The screens turn on and off with a switch, and run a constant 4 screen split view of all my cameras. The whole camera thing is silly to me if you aren't able to view them in a moments time when someone rings the bell, or if you hear something strange. Sure, everyone's able to look on their phones - but the monitors they put in are amazing. Full HD quality, and great picture. 

I had some minor issues with my first NVR. It would reset in the middle of the night, and when I woke up my screens in both living areas were reset. I called Chris and he was back the next day. It turned out there was a small update on the NVR that wasn't done prior to sending a small shipment of NVR's out.  A new one was sent via the manufacturer, and we had a new unit installed 3 days later. 

Both very nice guys. Professional. Nice equipment. They take their shoes off. They pet the dog. All in all, good experience and have recommended them to a neighbor (after recent break-ins in the subdivision -- 3 in total)."
7evREZcxL5TyeHgCrkbSog,"My Tech was Nestor, I had my new TV set up with receiver, 6 speaker surround sound, and my computer. Nestor was very knowledgeable, and his customer service was was excellent. The Gentleman who initially took my call (sorry I forgot his name) was also very knowledgeable, and professional. I will definitely recommend this company to anyone with A/V needs."
01elCI0hpmwYMNow4BVqmQ,"Jeremy came to our house on time, took off his shoes (without being asked!), was incredibly patient and helpful (marked the buttons we need to push) as he reworked some things we tried to install. He also did quite a bit of troubleshooting and will be back to help us again (per our request) as we need him for more than just the first request (we had purchased a new receiver and couldn't seem to hook it up to the existing whole house speaker system). We now have music that plays through the house and it is wonderful (and precisely what we needed). Reasonable rates and someone we can trust to come back and help us with the next project."
a9algffMWW3Xfd0XJrBN6g,Had multiple items installed in my office and I couldn't be happier with the service and the wonderful team. Will be doing more business with Jeremy and Elite A/V! If you have a chance to get services from them TAKE IT!!! You will be glad you did!!!
t-n7KqwpC_C6CvXwaEbAMQ,"I am highly satisfied with the work Jeremy and his associate did at my house. I mounted a tv and needed someone to run the cables through the wall. It was a relatively small job and I was wondering if I could even find someone to do it. Just like the other reviewers mention, Jeremy quickly and politely answered my email. Within a week he had come to my house once, on time, knowledgeable and prepared to complete the job. He tested everything out and cleaned up and the installation looks great! I will use Elite again and will recommend them as well."
Hv3D_IjfiYUDbsCGYn11nw,"Called from reviews on Yelp and could not have been more professional. Upgraded a 15 year old home theater and Jeremy gave me everything and more within my budget. In addition, Dillon and his team did an amazing job with install. My theater is like new thanks to these guys. Don't buy from anyone else. Go directly to them and they will get you the right products and install within your budget."
I_6O_cvIKIC95eABzElHhQ,"Jeremy and team did a fantastic job installing several new cameras and moving some A/V equipment from my existing entertainment center into a media room.  Everything is controlled with a single remote control.  The work was done in a timely manner and very clean.  That was my biggest fear...holes in walls, exposed wires, etc.  They ran all cables through the canned lights in the ceiling on the 1st floor of a 2 story house.  Very nice job.  Highly recommended."
jCO3usFRajdiJWNc81OdAA,"i used these guys through angie's list..
extremely satisfied with their work..

had a tv mounted and wires hidden behind 2 tv's.. 
they didnt try to ""overcharge' for the materials i needed from them. 
(needed longer wires).

jeremy could do the work with his eyes closed.
 
they cleaned up everything after they were done...

will definitely use them again when i need."
J1PFiTIS3w6hQvq68SJ9Ww,"These guys are the best!  So helpful and so on the ball.  They walked me through all of my options and let me pick the one that best fit me :)

I totally recommend this company!"
3iDb1885wERBB5_vAILDbg,"Ok, I just had one of the best customer service experiences in my life! I called Elite A/V after reading the yelp reviews.  I called because the picture on my smart TV would go black if I even moved the receiver a fraction of an inch. Also I couldn't get Netflix audio to play through my surround sound. I called the office around noon today and the technician, Dylan, was at my door at 4:00 pm. Dylan was as professional, courteous and knowledgeable as it gets. Within 10 minutes Dylan had run a new HDMI cable inside the wall, switched some connections and presto now Netflix audio was playing through my surround sound! All that was perfect but it got even better. I asked Dylan about television options outside of the cable companies. We talked about Roku for streaming various shows and channels. Dylan was kind enough to offer to come back another day and set me up with Roku at no extra charge (outside of the cost for the Roku itself) as he had only been there about 20 minutes out of the hour I was being charged. Well it turned out that Dylan had a new Roku in his truck and 30 minutes later Dylan had helped us set up an account and explained in detail how it worked. Dylan even loaded some free channels for us. I'm an older guy, in fact I think I have some socks older than Dylan but he was extremely patient and courteous in explaining everything. Now I can really reduce or even eliminate my Direct TV bill. Incredible! 
Please use Elite A/V for any home theater needs you may have.
I can't recommend them any higher and can't thank Dylan enough for his assistance."
zjVrZIXJ5i69ABkvXaxCGA,"They came to install a TV and a huge white board in our office. Jeremy was very friendly and was a pleasure to be around. We had great conversation as he was hanging the items in our office. They were in and out and didn't take long at all. They kept everything clean and provided coverage for the ground to ensure easy clean up! The office looks awesome! Called to make payment and they were super friendly. 

Thanks Elite A/V LLC!"
sJtQ7en6EU_J5pDA8fFfAA,"I worked with Elite A/V to install sound system and surveillance cameras for commercial gym. Great experience. They made good recommendations, didn't try to screw me with equipment mark ups, and did quality work. A couple weeks after completing the job, I couldn't get a receiver to work right and they were still very responsive and came right over and fixed my problem. Professional and good value. I will definitely call them again for my next job."
mSl35v2anEHJ1Zd1Nh0MsA,These guys are great!  They mounted a 55 inch in a tough spot no problem. Highly recommended.
IpJ20cWcn3L8yr2e8-8Vww,"I called 4 different places to get estimates for installing in ceiling speakers for a surround sound system. 2 of them were very high priced and out of my budget. It came down to Elite and another company. All of them were pleasant to speak to but Dylan with Elite really listened to me, worked with me on my budget and found something that I'm very satisfied with. I didn't need anything on the high end and had him install a 5.1 speaker system that fit right in my budget. 

Dylan called me the day before to confirm our appointment and also called me about an hour before arriving as well. As a business owner and service provider this is a practice that I find invaluable to both the customer and the vendor. Upon arrival he took great care in covering up all my furniture and electronics to insure a clean and complete install.

He installed 8"" 5.1 speakers to my receiver for TV, Blu Ray and X Box which I absolutely love! He also hooked up my turntable. Everything was calibrated to my liking. Dylan even walked me through activating my sub-woofer which I accidentally shut off after he left. He also contacted me the next day to make sure I was satisfied. I appreciated his professional courtesy, work ethic and customer service. Great product and service at a great price installed by a customer service oriented company."
t1f4TGx5HrljSXivHrWQSQ,"I have to give it to these guys...they are awesome!  Being I was working on a tight budget and having older audio equipment, Elite came to the rescue.  I want to give a shout out to Dylan and Erik (along with his son), for the awesome job you all did for us.  They were all very professional and the end result is great!  Erik (and son) were thorough, explained things along the way and kept everything clean as they went.  I would definitely recommend Elite A/V to anyone interested in having their audio/video professionally hooked up.  Thanks again you guys, and keep up the good work."
k3sKfRugv_jS-KubQoeS2Q,"This Company is Amazing! I have worked with Jeremy & his Crew so many times. I cant get enough of these guys. TV's on the wall, speakers in the ceiling. They even got my PC set up as a Server so I can stream music & videos everywhere. Call them today or stop by their shop and say Hi!"
LqIyw5ZKKBApLjOvsLkhAQ,"The Best Audio Video company I have ever experienced.  
They are LICENSED, BONDED, INSURED.  
These guys are Professional.  Jeremy took my call and had his crew come over the same day!  They diagnosed an existing custom home speaker system and mounted the TV's very quickly.  The team was prepared, clean and respectful.  
They made sure they did not leave until the system worked perfect.  They checked all the TV/Blue Ray/DVR settings to make it work the way I wanted.  It is a large crew that can handle big or multiple jobs.
Workmanship is really great.  The wires were run in the wall on both applications.  They have decades of experience!!
Value: Their prices are very fair for the quality of work (Excellent)!

I highly recommend Elite A/V LLC."
_28D4J_9deipnsuoeoR0zQ,"I used amazon services to get connected for the Elite A/V team to mount my TV. They did an awesome job. The Elite A/V team were amazing. They were professional and  courteous even removing the shoes upon entering the house and vacuuming a small amount of dust up when done. It was clear they took their time to measure everything out and assist in making suggestions on where to place the TV. 
For any future AV or home automation, I'll definitely give these guys a call."
eM-AT1KP2hnIDmL8SPsVvg,These guys are the best and they work fast too. They did a security camera install at our office and it came out just how we wanted. They were very fair with their estimate and did a great job in a timely manner. The camera system is awesome. I even have real time access from my iphone which they set up for me. (This is great when you want to see what your employees are doing while you're gone for lunch). Chris and Jeremy are both cool guys and will give it to you straight. I will use them again in the future.
FaaRmoUar2q26rEej9SpYg,Jeremy and Maurice came to our home on 6/24/14 to clean up a mess of wires for our home theater and internet system that have been that way for several years. We have paid other techs to do the same job but the wires were still left in a mess. This time we finally found someone who knows how to do the job right. Jeremy and Maurice are coming back in a few months to change out the ceiling speakers with new larger and directional speakers and have given us other options for updating our 7 year old system. If you have any TV or Sound system issues call Elite no job is too big or too small. Great company.
X7dsBB49QvsBQdB9DjLbkA,"Great! I had been looking for a while for someone to mount my new television for me and everyone I found was either too pricey or just didn't seem professional enough. I spoke with Jeremy at Elite AV and he was kind enough to tell me over the phone which type of mounts I would need as well as what he sold in comparison to the retail stores. I trusted him merely from this phone call and when he came a few days later for an installation I knew I made the right choice! Very professional and very knowledgeable!!

Thanks Jeremy!"
1pDdrbqNK6RoeedFwUXQAA,"Jeremy was originally going to stop by and give me an estimate then he went ahead and mounted two tvs for me on the spot. He's very professional , competitively priced, and knows his stuff. I plan on using his company for my home theater installation as well once he finalizes the estimate."
yduDCONn6bwo8QKcVtSDYg,"I got a great deal on a high end 12 camera security system but needed someone to the install and found Elite A/V LLC on Angies.  I messaged them and Jeremy replied within 24 hours and we made an appointment for a walk around. Our place is single story with a large foot print at 3600 sq ft and I wanted full perimeter and entry coverage. We have vaulted ceilings in over half of the house, with very little attic space on that half so running cables is no walk in the park.

Jeremy and his crew were always very polite and professional and I am very happy with the work they did,  They did all the camera cabling, setup the dvr and did some upgrades to our 2gig alarm system. I feel I got a very fair price on the work that was done.

I plan on adding 4 more cameras down the line and will definitely use them again."
MdGRvbq9jp7DP_mWTPNnpg,"Decided to get a new 55"" TV installed in our bedroom and did a service request online on Sunday and woke up to the owners response on Monday morning that they would try to get to us the same day!
The techs called at 8 am to let me know they would be there at 10 and they were actually there on time ready to rock with tools in hand. This really impressed me as most companies want to see the job and try the up sell dance 1st before unloading a thing from their truck! These guys knew they were there to work and were prepared to do just that!
They were very neat and meticulous and got the TV up and running in no time. They explained everything and took the time to answer all of my questions.
I would highly recommend Elite A/V to handle any of your audio video and home automation needs!!
Thanks Jeremy and crew!!"
4k2T0BI3ckGIBZqSOBZVRQ,"Very very pleased, Jeremy is very knowledgeable and they know their product well.  Also, his crew was really nice every time when they came out to install their equipment.  This company is completely professional, responsive, and attentive.  I was so pleased that when they finished their job everyone cleaned up, and did not leave a mess."
xJEqLOXo_qt59FmznGLrhw,"Been using Jeremy and his guys for some time now, very professional and very honest. Will be using him again very soon when I move into my new house. Highly recommended!"
eHDeZ0g7qK1C6xYO7g2Y7Q,"I had to take a moment and brag on Jeremy!  He is the MAN!  His prices were very reasonable.  He and his staff were quite professional and we punctual, I would definitely recommend him if you want a professionally installed system!"
mum_khkgKQH9Q0C0h0yoyA,Absolutely Fantastic.  Jeremy was not only on time and friendly but the guy really knows his stuff.  He went the extra mile but didn't nickle and dime me over everything.  I'll definitely be telling everyone I know about Elite A/V
xX8PwroTrDtgS3oQd6KwGg,"Jeremy, Chris and Dylan did a great job. They are very professional and knowledgeable.  Highly recommend them."
_SJB_jlfykAcmfr1nDIr-w,"Elite AV has done all my stereo equipment in my home, my hard and now my home theatre. I recommend them to all my friends. Jeremy and his team are quick, responsive and were able to get my home movie theatre in place in time for Christmas. 

They even stay late and show up any day. I haven't been happier with a tech service. 

A big Thank You to Elite AV

Geoff Radcliffe"
FipyDsIhPFcftYHuRxByPA,"Jeremy is the best - highly knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy and fair. Everything you could ask for in an A/V specialist! In addition, his team is extremely courteous and respectful when working in my home, and they pay incredible attention to detail. I highly recommend them!"
3eq_FMJvhMH_JHqwke3vwg,"This review is a long time over due. I have dealt with Jeremy in the past. When he told me he was sending one of his guys out to check an issue I was having , I was a little reluctant because I am picky about who works on my system. Dylan showed up promptly and even contacted us prior to him showing up. He sold me on 2 universal remotes for my living room and my theater. At first I thought it was a bit pricey but after the amazing job Dylan did I feel like I should have paid more. My system works better than it ever has and above any expectations I could have imagined. He was very concerned with my needs and asked many questions to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm sorry it took so long to leave a review but I was just using my remote thinking how simple everything has become and felt the need to leave this review. So thank you very much Dylan and Jeremy. Job well done and more."
jdKrExb-h5pd-kBwXssrHQ,"Great job by the Elite AV team on setting up my 65"" 4K TV and receiver.  In addition they also set up my XBox, Apple TV and DVD player and checked the surround sound speakers, wub woofer and center speakers to make sure everything was working right.  I couldn't be happier with the care they showed to our home in set up and clean up.  I was very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others."
KGiA2Lxai5adACYCLQItGg,"Jeremy is the best!  He is super professional.  His work is outstanding.  He is current on all the new and latest technology out there.  He always has a solution on how to update and improve any audio/visual stuff I have going on in my house   His work is meticulous.  He is neat with his wiring and labeling, making it easy and clear for anyone to understand how to operate anything he has put together.  

He is reliable.  He is prompt with return phone calls, emails and appointments.  
I would confidently recommend Elite A/V!!!"
fRRHN2JYwQQhqGw4YbF18w,"I hired Jeremy and his team to mount 26 TVs for a few commercial projects in Vegas and they did a wonderful job! They were professional, on time, and very reasonably priced. I would definitely use them again!"
NutUW2Iwit1NBAou9xcH6g,"From scheduling to installation day, everything went smoothly and as planned. This company is very professional and Jeremy and Chris were great in answering my questions, on behalf of my employer, for a surround sound installation in his home. They called prior to arriving, arrived on time and were prompt in setting up the system. Would recommend them to anyone."
PHuOc9WctKozsb-QRwLuqQ,"Not sure where to start with these guys as they did seem very interested in installing a camera system in my home, their sales rep that came out even appeared very knowledgeable about their craft. A week later I followed up with them to see if they had come up with an estimate and was informed that they didn't have my contact information. When I finally did get the estimate it left off things we discussed and seemed a bit high, so I replied asking for clarification. Again a week went by with no reply until Jeremy contacted me to ask if I received their estimate, when I told him I had but had some questions and that I had replied to their original email asking for clarification. As we started to go over my questions I was informed that Chris was now out of town and Jeremy would have him contact me when he got back. Again a week went by with no contact until a third person called to follow up and see if I ever got the quote? I told the third person that I had and discussed it with Jeremy the prior week and I was still waiting to hear back from Chris, I was told he would follow up. As it turns out Chris did call a few minutes later but he didn't use my home number so his call went to voicemail. Never did talk with Chris but yet a fourth person called after another couple of days to follow up on the original quote. As I stated at the beginning they do appear very capable of doing a first rate job, but I will never know as their follow up to questions was basically nonexistent as their only real follow up was to ask for the job not answer any of my question and when we are looking at a $6,000 camera install, they could take a few minutes to answer questions. Reading all their reviews it does appear that I'm in the minority but I get the impression they really have very little internal communication or perhaps my job was just over their head, I'll really never know."
J-Of_NmoovyR1qfPnvUHOA,"Why haven't I reviewed this guys sooner?
They are awesome, excellent, professional and more!

I had them come to my house to relocate some A/V wiring, and while they where here they spotted some wiring issues on my Home theater system and fixed them at no additional charge, they even went into my attic to re-route some wiring.

They are so good, I hired them to do the complete system / network wiring for 
a company I work for!"
2D8mKvnDXppI-6fv4sONOg,"Read the reviews and were impressed, so I thought I would give them a try.  I'm glad I did.  They deserve the ratings and live up to their reputation.  I was fortunate to remodel my home and could include them in the design of every room.  They were patient all throughout the process.  As with most all construction projects, change, change, change!  They stuck it through and were able to accommodate the entire way.  The prewire looked excellent.  They thought ahead and made sure wires could be pulled easily through the attic by hanging them rather than laying them on top of the beams ( I thought that was worth mentioning).  When we finally finished, they came to install all the fun stuff.  All the equipment was placed in a professional rack.  They even added LED's which gave it a nice touch! Most importantly, everything works like they advertised.  My lights are programmed for scenes and just need a push of a single button.  My automation system even reminds me to take out the trash. I'm living in the future thanks to Elite AV."
i9Dg3BF4Lagz9XhaYOPvDg,"Iam sitting here in my awesome home theater-man cave!!! Chris did a great job hooking up and wiring my place of Both entertainment and refuge!! The whole company from start to finish was very knowledgable, professional, experienced, fairly / competitively priced and cool to work with... I would highly recommend them for all your AUDIO VISUAL install needs!!!! This company gets 5 stars!!!! Now I will get back to my movie and popcorn!!!!!!!!!!"
eKgZzyOK4dukD2-5HlqcHQ,"I am blown away by how awesome these guys were!! They just left, and I couldn't wait to jump on and give them a rave review!! My new tv is installed perfectly, and I'm actually in a great mood despite waking up at 8:30 a.m. to let strangers into my home, thanks to their great attitudes, their polite efficiency, and their kindness. They were so pleasant and funny and helpful, and they left everything clean and saved me a whole mountain of trouble. I could not be happier!!!"
hD2FcTJjYQC7pjlC_VKDHA,"BOY YOU GOT IT.  THEY ARE GOOD, FAST AND VERY PROFESSIONAL.  We have 2 surround systems and several TVs that we have upgraded, added a sound bar outside and 
installed Rogu on all of them through out our home.  Dylan and his team also installed a complete system with a TV in each of the bedrooms and in the living area (7 total big screen tvs ) and all the bells and whistles at our Air B & B.  Everything works perfect and sounds outrageous.  I can't tell you how HAPPY WE ARE!!  IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF ANY AUDIO, VIDEO SYSTEM, OR INTERGRATION, DYLAN IS THE TECH YOU NEED TO CALL.  We have had service done by others and we always have had problems. They would come and fix a problem, and we would end up with a different problem because of it and each time it cost us a lot of money.  Not with Dylan and his team  THEY GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  They actually give you a real phone number and are happy to answer any questions you may have.  They show up on time and get right to work and even clean up after themselves.  So Woohoo is right!!!!"
nkRjA9pR-1BuAOpxSm_eSQ,Dylan and Travis did a great job mounting my TV. Will 100 percent be using this company in the future.
AZk5Ol7AfaPNSRh32EPx2w,"These guys are very professional they were on time everything was setup with perfection they even vacuum my floors as they were going! Fair an reasonable price I would highly recommend this company an iam a very very picky guy but they met all my expectations with flying colors so iam a happy customer thank alot u guys for my 135"" projector screen look like An AMC theater lol !!!!!!!"
pUGLFqTxnyn7etvgOdEoAQ,"Had Dylan and his crew come out to my place to install a TV Wall Mount and then had them come out again to install a set of in-wall and in-ceiling speakers.  I love home theater and was very particular about how I wanted everything laid out. They were very patient and worked with me on making sure they mounted and installed everything exactly the way I wanted.  My project required cutting and drilling in to my walls and they went too great lengths to protect all my furniture and equipment from the dust and debris while they worked. When they were done, they vacuumed up all the mess and made sure the furniture was carefully moved back.  They do good work, take pride in what they do, and are very reasonable when it comes to cost of labor. Definitely will use again or recommend to others."
ofptsz58IA4WXuAL0wlwCw,"This review is almost 2 years past due, but they did such a great job that I felt I still owed it to them. We needed an extra large TV mounted and were looking into having surround sound installed. They suggested a sound bar and booster instead of adding ceiling speakers which turned out to be more economical and it sounds incredible. We have had no issues at all and are very happy with the system. These guys were clean and efficient and fairly priced. We will not hesitate to use them if the need should arise in the future."
S5nc2__82BDbV6vK7XFnFA,"Elite A/V did an amazing job installing two 65"" and two 55"" TVs in our new home. Jake came out and did a comprehensive analysis of what options were available which provided us with a great menu from which to choose how much we wanted to do. On the day of installation, the crew was here for most of the day. They were efficient, respectful, NEAT AND CLEAN, and did a superb job of installing and explaining what the myriad remotes were for. A special THANK YOU to Dylan - he stayed longer to get us signed up for and explain Roku, Pluto, etc. Since that day, I've texted Dylan with questions several times and he even called me at 8:00 at night to talk about an issue. He has always responded within 30 minutes and has always solved my problem. I cannot imagine ever, ever using anyone else for my a/v, sound, and entertainment needs!

Thank you Dylan. Jake and the entire Elite Crew!!!
Michele and Harold"
2_NFevOvKndOqRTxVfjukw,"We can't give enough praise to Elite A/V. when we hired them(for TVs and wire system)we were skeptical. Because we didn't know anything about A/V system. But they(Jeremy and all team crew)were very honest & knowledgeable, professional. My Husband is very specific but they worked with us very friendly and we had great customer service. We were very Happy what we got from Elite A/V service. I highly recommend this company to all."
cFOKVjKLuCwIw2gGzcttLA,Chris is a true mensch! He did a super professional install of a flat panel and promised me he would come back and make a minor adjustment when I requested a change. He did make that adjustment and without additional charge like he promised.  Good quality and good service is a hard combo to find in vegas but this company has both!
BD7dFrhc4d9ONtLAlufn5w,The ultimate professionals. Prompt and efficient. Highly knowledgable and courteous. Job well done!
eQ0RQyNQRIdTj2x2IMoyqA,"Jeremy is a great worker, very knowledgable and honest. Such quality work for the price too! I highly recommend Elite AV."
r4CD2HXP8GKDSAWs7e7YPA,"This company is amazing. We have a small office near to them and they were able to understand and take care of all of our needs. We were looking for a camera system with remote viewing capability, an in-ceiling music system and an alarm system. They provided great equipment and expert solutions for all of our issues and worked within our budget. They were even able to tie into some of our existing components. We were impressed that the installation went quickly and smoothly. The mess from the installation was cleaned up so well, you would never have know anyone was there. All of the equipment works and sounds great. Jeremy and entire team at Elite AV were professional and an absolute pleasure to work with. They are truly experts in this field with a depth of understanding that I could not find anywhere else. Both the service and products they sell are all top notch. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for any type of audio, video or alarm system for their home or business."
K2DepW4Udrll8NquwmtnvA,Jeremy did a fantastic job at a fair price and we have stellar sound in our home and our patios. On top of that we finally have a universal remote that actually works and with our Sonos receiver we can select multiple inputs and place select audio in select rooms or flood the home and patio with the same audio. No surprises and quality work. Let Jeremy show you how to accomplish your needs without breaking your bank!
WByQ7OFuLfFJxwT5AwySQg,"Couldn't be happier with the service from Elite.  We first started with Tweeter years ago for our initial home theater setup.  Then we went with Geek Squad.  Still not satisfied, we turned to Yelp & found Elite A/V.  We will not use anyone else.  Jeremy was very helpful in our initial visit.  We had him do a small job recently & couldn't have been more professional.  Always on time; did what had been contracted & we couldn't be happier with the result.  There's no way you can go wrong with Elite."
S-Fqu07mfZkjBUkLjxw8CA,Super professional! I bought a flatscreen tv from them and they were comparable to big-box retailers. Best part is they mounted it on the wall for half the cost of big-box retailer. We will use them for subsequent television needs!
I2PxtNWVDLlU6jdgcJ3AVg,"Jeremy and Chris are as good as as A/V installers can get and their guys are just as good! Professional, on time and really good to work with!  They made the entire process fun.  First, you can immediately tell that these guys know what they are doing - they've ""been there and done that.""  They are personable, professional and make you feel at ease - whether you buy gear from them or have your own, you can be assured that they will treat you the same and give you top notch advice on both integration and installation.  Although it's always best to get the gear from them and what they recommend, if you already have your own, they'll still work with you - which is different than MOST companies who will refuse your work altogether.  This is why Elite is so great.  My project was by far NOT the biggest because I'm a geek and like to do a lot myself, but they didn't shy away.  They did the work with a fervor and completed it with just as much energy and enthusiasm as if it was an entire house automation system with $250k worth of gear.  If you choose another company to do your work, you are making a mistake.  They did ZERO damage, nothing was amiss, the place was treated with respect and they were laughing and joking with me the entire time making me feel comfortable.  They quoted me to install my projector and screen, but even spent time terminating a few sub cables I had and did a quick calibration on the projector just to ensure the screen was ""OK.""  Who does that?  In Las Vegas, where everyone is out for the money, this is a company that is more interested in customer satisfaction and value.  I would work with them again in a heart beat.  Again, if you choose another company for your work - it's your mistake, don't say I didn't warn you!

PS: When they make a recommendation, believe me - take it."
YGOISlCVv9rrTRr1kt8coA,"These guys were Prompt, Punctual and Professional. Was able to get the job scheduled the next day and they finished my TV mounting w/in a few hours and did a clean job. Good job guys!"
Sq-66PV6yju_jrGyvcuRYA,"I have been going to DT for over 5 years.

For a dealership, I find they are pretty fair in the pricing and they do some extras, like wash your car for you.

You can also have your scheduled maintenance (like oil changes/tire rotation) done on a Saturday - they are open until 4 pm.
For those of us needing our cars during the week -- it works great.

If you drop it off around noon - you can check out Dark Horse Coffee across the street, or Burger Shoppe, or Prohibition, also if you want Brunch there is Bonjour Brioche just up the street (great quiches and baguette!)

Also, Toyota has a loyalty program now (no cost to enroll), and all your maintenance spend gets recorded, and you can use points towards service or other items.  The time before this time my Oil change was free."
wj3Ec7JeTcZH11KnS1KmuA,I've used this dealer intermittently since 1999. They do repairs well the first time but have had mistakes the last few visits. A couple years ago they left the window down and soaked the back seats when washing it. There was no apology or warning when I picked it up. I had to buy garbage bags to carry passengers the next couple days so they could sit on them. This past visit for regular maintenance I Was called because there were a few light bulbs out. I said I would do it myself and I found them changed anyway and the $38 added in at the end of my bill after pick up. I was going to do it myself because I already had spare ones in the storage and it takes 3 minutes or less. I'm becoming very skeptical about any dealership in this city!!!!
JezSSIzp9EbWLiNGOfoO_w,"This sad excuse of a car dealership should either be shut down by Toyota or their manager should be fired. Has no one ever explained to these people that calls should be returned? I as well, have also caught them doing unnecessary work on my Camry. My new mechanic tells me it served me right going there!"
syxMa7g_giGzJqWly-fMRA,"A few weeks ago received a letter from downtown toyota, saying that they're very interested in buying back my 2013 Prius c, I didn't think anything of it as I'm very happy with my car.  So a few days ago, I received a call from a Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, asking me if I was interested in selling my 2013 Prius c back to them, and that they can compensate me, and give me some kind of offer on a new car.

I've never been asked for a buy back, so I thought what's the harm, I thought I go and see what they were going to offer me.  At first nothing was laid out clearly, but we slowly got to see what the numbers were, because all I wanted to see was the numbers, that's all I wanted.  Lisa stepped out and I talked to the manager (indian) directly,  we talked for a while,  still couldn't get a confirmation on what the set monthly payment will be, he wanted me to say yes before giving me the final offer, then he started to get very impatient with me, I felt very uncomfortable/pressured,  we ended the talk and that was that.

Before going home, I went over to the service department to chat with an advisor, I had some thing I wanted to ask him, then Lisa came back and started giving me better offers, now that I have the numbers, I see what I was actually into,  but I decided the better option of me was to keep the car that I have, and continue driving it.   Throughout the whole process, Lisa stayed really patient and professional, but I kept saying no and they kept giving me better offers.

At the end, I decided not to trade in for a new car, but Lisa still gave me a warm good bye, but another manager (caucasian) still trying to strike a deal, asking what would be a number I'm happy with, said he can tried to see if he can offer me a 90 days free of payment, I wasn't bluffing, I really was there to see what the offer was and decided I am better off with not trading my car, at the end he question me what I came the first place, which I did not appreciate.

Overall, I highly recommend anyone looking for a toyota to talk to Product Advisor: Lisa Tu, but I would be very wary of the managers there, and do your research before going.  The indian manager told me toyota will still continue to offer the the prius c and prius v (wagon) for another two years, which I am not sure if he is just saying that to make a sale, or if it's confirmed.

From my understanding, the prius c/v will most likely not get replaced, and only the standard prius, and maybe later a plug in prius will be added to the line up."
T9ZraFRugttlk-9efhRZyg,"I'd give these guys negative stars if I could. I took my car in to get two engine sensors replaced, and after diagnosis, they handed me an estimate of approx $4000. That's the price of a new engine! I proceeded to tell them no, took my car to a mechanic that I know and trust (Heffner's Toyota in Kitchener) , and found out that this is a tactic that dealers use to get you to buy a new car. I wouldn't trust these guys to fix a lawnmower engine in the future. Be forewarned, this dealership is not to be trusted."
WsRN6Te_4FnvvrQKYn1gFQ,"I went there once...now they keep calling me to remind be about service using a 'blocked number"" - what a waste of my time and minutes. No legit business calls customers with a blocked number."
XpBTjBrmUArU3bCQeMQr-w,Adequate service if your car is under warrantee. My engine light has been on for a year. 3 visits (charged each time) they are still incapable of fixing it. Different excuse every time.  Pretty expensive even for an oil change. Long wait times even for the most straightforward repairs.  Not great at returning calls. There are better places unless you really want to get repairs at dealership. Not great service off warrantee.  I think I'll find somewhere else for service. Suggest you do too.
Bz5kR052DviDGQGV_q8VUQ,"Dipped cone all the way! This location is tricky because it gets very busy in the evenings. Best route, don't go in the drive-thru, park your car and order inside. It's quicker and easier!"
Sc2eLc1kTsehqraMhrT1zg,Always amazing food and service. Love their chicken Parm sandwich. Their blizzards are awesome too.
Qpz73uZ60Gk7MSKbD6Y6_A,"This place is literally the worst. Hopefully the got rid of the awful management, because the owner is actually sort of nice. I ordered ice cream and just got a sloppy mess and no apology."
NdjK8rttbevfoDwgXcL-eg,Very nice and new. Staff is always friendly but the drive thru is ridiculous. Two burgers and a diet soda and Im still sitting here 10 minutes after the fact? People have stuff to do. I could cook a meal at home in this time.
2PoRWtHb6ulqr8AJv_QGhA,"Nothing special about this place, their ice cream is ok. On busy nights drive thru is insane and impossible to turn left out of here. Prices are high too. The employees are really nice and it is a clean store."
WlqmIvizN8A_oKNR-MPuPw,"I love this location! The staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, you just can't beat the $5 meal special."
hv_cMHLMgc2J4-lL8Pz-aQ,"Upon my usual weekly jaunt down to the St. Lawrence market I found myself staring into a neatly tucked away Shoppers Drug Mart at the corner of Esplenade and Jarvis. A life sized Justin Bieber cut out (my 11 year old selfs secret fantasy), was strategically display in the front window of the Beauty Boutique along with his latest fragrance line to draw in any stray window shoppers ( of course I'm convincing myself it was really my subconscious wanting to escape the mere minus 30 weather outside) 

Walking in I certainly didn't expect to walk out with over $200 worth of cosmetics. Upon first entering I was greeted by a lovely tall, bubbly, blonde that not only looked but sounded like a Disney princess. She was quick to ask if I needed any help or if there was anything in particular I was looking for. When I assured her I was just ""browsing"" as us window shoppers do, she offered to give me a complimentary makeover. I have never been one to decline a little free pampering here and there so I quickly obliged making my self comfortable on a fancy black chair next to her. 

And so It began; a little Clarins Ever Matte foundation, followed by both Benefit blush in Coralista and Benefit They're Real mascara ( which might I add is probably the best mascara in the existence of mascaras), next was the Lise Watier lipstick in Evasion and to finish it off a spritz of Marc Jacobs new scent ""Dot"" ...vuala  she held up a mirror to show me her finished canvas and ten minutes later I was standing at the check out. 

The customer service was great, the product knowledge of the associate was excellent, the sales pitch was well played, the free samples were an added bonus...oh and my fancy new picture beside the Justin Bieber cutout left my 11 year old self jumping up and down on the inside. If you are looking to buy cosmetic this is the place to visit."
m4RaPqSQrrBylNeavSR5Ew,"A decent sized Shoppers Drugmart which has a full service pharmacy and has groceries as well. They recently added as small meat and fresh vegetable section . It is clean and the staff are friendly. The only thing I would change is the hours it should be open 24 hours, being located downtown."
SWIImMwG2fqyslaSDKH_mQ,"Large, beautiful and clean beauty boutique with brands that aren't typically found in Shoppers!"
iX9NxaTkZnq-95bW1Gz5YQ,"I'm not sure what's wrong with the photo printer at this location, but my passport photos came out spotty and washed out. It's 15$ for 2 so they better be good!

The rest of the store is just a regular shoppers like any other. Sometimes they do samples."
_YmWWNS9OOswRohdzho1xA,"i wanted to write a note about the great service I had recently at this location. I went in looking for makeup products and I am not really knowledgable in that regard but the Cosmetic Attendant (bright red/orange hair) was great. She came right over and asked if we needed help, she pointed out quality products and could tell me all about them. She saved me so much time and effort! Thanks again!"
pWl_vlyglH-kse60JV66ng,"This is the latest addition to feed my Shoppers Drug Mart addiction.  I strolled in laden down with groceries on the opening day, looking like a vagrant, but was treated like a red carpet worthy customer.  I was served by Maxine, the beauty manager, and she was simply lovely.  Very sweet, knowledgeable, sense of humour and not at all pushy.  I walked out happier than when i walked in and it was purely based on service received; not the cut price package of Pirate cookies that made it into my basket.

The store itself is medium sized but seems to pack pretty much everything in.  You have to scoot by the Beauty Boutique to get to the main part which is pretty sneaky.  It's so hard to resist all those shiny, colourful (and expensive) things.  It's a well stocked Beauty Boutique too with the usual Lancome, Clarins, Elizabeth Arden etc as well as Lise Watier, Benefit etc.   The rest of the store is sparkling (well, it is new) and full of the usual mixture of a few groceries, medications, cosmetics etc.  Staff were genuinely pleasant and everybody seemed happy to be there.

This one is  a keeper.  I'll definitely be adding it to my list of places to spend money!"
MLmlMcB1xi2F6YIBgFpw1w,This has been my go to dentist office for years. I absolutely love it. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The dentist are all amazing and very gentle. I had two teeth pulled on a Monday evening and was back at work on Tuesday working with no swelling or pain.
Ijm3wuAfraUD1RLeRZZUgg,"Kudos to Vogel & Matesi and specifically to assistant Sally and Dr. Savla.
I was traveling to Phoenix and was in tremendous pain.
Not only were they able to fit me in their busy schedule, they did the first stage of root canal very quickly and professionally, the pain was gone right after!
Thank you guys!"
xj4VRhFoO9cZQ-ImW8gpeg,"Dental Horror Stories Not Found Here

I know of:

A mother tells a dentist to drill and fill anything on her children so she can show high expenses for a legal settlement.

Pull anything with a cavity for Native American patients visiting Public Health Services in the 1960's.

After my military entry physical the dentist proposed  filling 7 teeth immediately. I skipped the offer.

During my military exit physical four years later four  fillings were offered. I accepted two, skipped two and had no more cavities/fillings for a decade.

A California reconstructive dentist building a crown for me rained me with a shower of things I MUST do NOW.  None inexpensive.

Dr. Vogel has been balanced regarding my dentistry. His staff have kept my teeth clean and healthy 12+ years. When we get to dental requirements not in his lane, he's made excellent referrals to an endodontist and an oral surgeon."

For the next hour and a half, we flew through all of the canyons along the ""Apache Air Trail"" as the pilot called it.  The pilot, Carl, is a 3rd generation pilot from Alaska and does a great job providing the history of the area along with some humor.  You get to see all of the bridges and dams along the way. The best part of the trip for me was the water landing on Lake Roosevelt.  Never done that before! After takeoff we then flew past ancient Indian cliff ruins, Weaver's Needle and the Superstitions before returning to Scottsdale.  What a fun time.  I maxed out the memory card in my camera but plan to do this again. They have powered kayaks you can use on Roosevelt that I want to try on the next trip."
ejaXLZp8NuEaChiJPNp3OQ,"A float plane in the desert? What?! This is the best deal ever in Arizona! 

The Apache Trail Tour starts at Scottsdale airport and flies you all over the Valley. Pilot Rob really knows his stuff and is a great narrator when it comes to the history of the area and what you're seeing out of your windows.

Splash landing!! But not bouncy. The touchdown on Roosevelt Lake was so smooth I actually couldn't tell when we landed on the water. After taxiing to the shore we were able to get out and explore for a while. 

The total time was two hours. This is a great tour for all ages. The kids had a blast and we had four generations on our plane. Everybody loved it! They do private parties and brunches on the lake as well. We will definitely be back!"
IMi5hPzWsx1qD-w3eko2Lw,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this experience.  We bid on this for a charity and had no expectations.  We've lived in Arizona for a long time and had no idea how gorgeous our state could be.  I'm not a fan of small planes but this was so easy and gorgeous.  Great people, gorgeous surroundings, and amazing food.  This is a can't miss Arizona experience!!"
dh4PtAgRHvjWA5m0uC77_g,"I got this ride as a christmas gift but put off doing it until the gift nearly expired.  I'm a private pilot and I've flown through the Superstition mountains a few times(though I never landed on the water) so it kind of didn't seem all that exciting to me.  Boy was I wrong!  Rob, the pilot, gave me a new appreciation for flying that route.  Its a great and exciting way to see the canyons and lakes of the east valley and do something few people ever experience.  

If you think you've seen it all around here, check out this tour."
FsS5TUFPI8QJEE60-HR3dw,"Wished it was better..
After watching man vs. food I decided to stop by, décor was not that homey and welcoming, and the neighborhood was bad, but nothing I haven't been around before.  The ribs were very fatty and grisly, it was disappointing and I didn't get enough sauce and when I asked for a little more they wanted to charge me, the coleslaw was awesome!  I noticed a hair in my food and it turned me off to the rest of it, so i threw it away , I wont be returning...
sorry guys"
7xGHiLP1vAaGmX6srC_XXw,"Decor and service leave much to be desired, but the food is worthy of 4.5 stars.
I've eaten at both locations several times now over the past year, since moving from San Diego, and I think the food is very good.  The fried chicken and Polish Boy in particular are awesome.  The ribs are just average. good sauce, but not super tender and have not been smoked enough for my taste."
ZWlXWc9LHPLiOksrp-enyw,My husband and I ate here tonight for the first time and it will NOT be our last! The fried chicken is best I've ever had  and my ppl are from South Carolina! His sauce is very very good! And the owner was very hospitable and spoke to us about the  history of this famous restaurant. They will be taping on Rachel Ray's show next week! Kudos y'all!
KpRwKYyQ93ypyDSdA7IXfw,"Don't believe the hype. Nooooo! 

In the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. 

Granted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. 

G Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). 

The fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.  

The buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. 

The sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). 

It isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a ""Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant"" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. 

The service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. 

Sort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. 

I'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients)."
OZvrgp4vWBsYqIt3-YMSEw,"Don't believe the hype!

After seeing this location on Man vs Food I had to check it out for myself. I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. 

The place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.

The employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. 

It took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.

The chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes. I'd much rather go to Zanzibar for their delicious honey fried chicken. Hell, I'll eeven take Church's Chicken instead!"
LDln5I1QXIIinI74RmjuSQ,Sauce spicy and blan absolutely no flavor the decor screams dont eat here plus the entire staff is moody not to mention chicken wings are 1.50 a piece a true rip off!
_Ob9cAp8dT0w1X5GsZP6vg,"Seti's truck wasn't around so we decided to head to a restaurant with polish boys that didn't have wheels. I'm really glad we did that - the combo of the polish...girl...was delicious!  It had the added pulled pork on it, the combo of flavors, perfect.  

What the fam really loved was that sauce.  I'll probably never be in Cleveland again, but I'll dream of that sauce.  We got the fried chicken, stuck the sauce on the side...but I can see why people just have it drenching that chicken.  Glad we did get it on the side, though, since it was glorious to dip everything into it.  Almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce."
g9VGCBuaZ079NtNNfmVPaA,"The location on 79th Carnegie, is a hot ghetto mess. I am ashamed of what the establishment has turned into. Maybe I'll try out superior or Lee rd."
3luqqY_D_XQCj_JUOaCL2w,"Let me just start by saying that this place did not live up to the Man V. Food hype. I think I have been to better buffets before.

Terrible customer service earned them one out five stars. Extremely rude and inconsiderate server. Took us ten minutes to place our order when at the front of the line. She decided to have side conversations while we were still ordering.

Food: I ordered the Polish Boy and Dark Meat Chicken. 

Polish Boy: Polish Sausage, Coleslaw, Fries, and BBQ sauce on a bun. It was drenched in sauce, making the bun soggy. It was not bad but was not all that. The sauce is not very good for BBQ. It is runny like Open Pit and has a little zing to it. Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible.

Chicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy. I enjoyed this part of the meal.

Overall, I would not return. No place should treat their guests with such arrogance and ineptness. I think I would rather take my money to Popeye's, its most comparable match."
Tfkyj1e0-_D_t2uos9W5gg,"I love Hot Sauce Wiliams. Well, I love their food. Their service is very hit or miss.

Though HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ. 

Where HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.

For drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer

Though I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.

If I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.

If you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment."
sDmMfrsRQtEPYx_X4mmpCw,"The food was okay. The wings and fries were not that fresh and very little chicken came on the bone. The sauce was ok. I like Open Pit Bar B Que's (Cleveland, OH) sauce better because it's sweeter. I tried this because it was on the travel channel. It really wasn't that good. I like Harold's Chicken Shack in Atlanta and Chicago way better when it comes to chicken and sauce."
DR0dmQGFGQQEgn_BvG3CCw,"Best fried chicken out there. Skip the hot sauce, it isn't hot, and is frankly pretty disgusting. The various sides on offer are mediocre. There is a high likelihood of there being no food in the restaurant, especially later in the day, so call before going. Seems like it's takeout only in spite of having a large restaurant space."
DySF6mE1hZ2GwzPA7sVdEQ,"1st time visitor. Portions were great and the personable service really gave it that home feel. Had the Rib Tip....my oh my, shut my mouth.  What was that devine creation?  Go get you some now! Good food + nice price = great atomphsere.  Enjoyed learning their history via the cook during her lunch break. You know if Samuel Jackson and Charlie Sheen dine there it's gotta be good."
R6wkvCo8OtSQetFyhTYGsA,"Hot Sauce Williams has some pretty poor BBQ, mediocre fried chicken, and an odd sauce that they'll put on either one.  Of course then there's the polish boy. I'll explain.

This place has become a Cleveland landmark, probably more from visits of Anthony Bourdain and ManVFood than anything else.   There are a number of similar spots in Cleveland and you have to respect it for what it is.  It's not the kind of place that's trying to win competitions here.  It's more of a fast-food style cheap BBQ.

On our most recent visit we got a polish boy and some fried chicken.  A polish boy is a kielbasa, fries, coleslaw, and sauce on a bun.  It's an unrefined mess and it's pretty tasty.  In my opinion their chicken is so-so.

The service seems to be down to business.  I wouldn't describe my experiences as overly friendly.

If you're an out-of towner I suggest trying it for what it is.  The polish boy is uniquely Cleveland.  The neighborhood is characteristic for much of the east side of the city.  It may not be pretty but it is what it is."
g3KutFVxg68VecHvFzkANA,"Despite being slathered in their sauce, this fried chicken surprisingly maintains its crispiness and isn't the least bit overpowered by the flavors of the sauce. Actually, the sauce compliments the chicken so well that it had me asking for more- I even bought a bottle of their original sauce for the road since we were just visiting Cleveland.
Of the two sides that were ordered, the mac n cheese tastes similar to a homemade baked dish packed with cheesy goodness. The fried okra was decent, but was coated in so much batter that I could barely taste the okra.
In addition to the good food, the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to Hot Sauce Williams"
ijrFuMmsYw8vI--DjkAQtA,I can't remember the last time I ate here because it has been that long. Well it will be my last... The menu on Yelp quotes one price so a slab dinner 19.95 when I pick up my food it's $29. The girl at the register rude even when you call in to order  tone very dry... Food over I should have saved myself the trouble and gas and just pulled out my own grill!
RD9R88hIOdkfWvsxXs3Swg,"I'm going to keep my review short and sweet! 

Polish Boy and the wings, OFF THE CHAIN!

Nuff siad!"
dMyrZA_EXD9y_UqK7-Hj0Q,Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland tradition! I will always stop here for the fries with sauce!
C_9CV4C722vQ_Atd9_LDRQ,"hot sauce williams is amazing, but it is certainly not a place to go for a low calorie meal. fried chicken, st. louis style ribs, mac n cheese, sweet potato pie, etc. it's all awesome. the fried chicken is done perfectly! my mouth waters just thinking of this place. its a simple place, you order from a counter and can either take your food to go or eat it there. all that matters is the food is killer!"
RYHKUSUyPeaU38RytDtZww,"I've been going to Hot Sauce Williams for the past 15 years and this place is going down hill big time!  The service continues to get worse and the attitude of the workers is piss poor.  They ignore you and can be very rude as well.  Also, the place is very dirty and I would love to see the health inspection report.  

I will admit there Sauce is some of the best I have ever had.  The wings are just not as good as they used too, but the Polish Boy is still very good.  The Mac n Cheese is very overrated and DO NOT ORDER THE RIBS.  They are like chowing down on a gristled piece of fat and that has the texture of rubber.  My friend tossed them away they were so bad.  

Very sad to see an Cleveland Institution goes down the tubes like this and hope they can improve but that's the last they have seen of my business.  

P.S-Don't even bother going through the drive thru unless you have 20 mins to spare, no joke."
yUeBnTvqPNB8Ay_5PS3kWg,"My girlfriend and I been dying to try this place for sometime, but never found the motivation to go until we saw the Anthony Bourdain episode when he was in Cleveland. We ordered the Family Meal (Full Slab, 8 Pcs of Chicken and 2 sides). When we ordered most of the sides were not available so our choices were limited.  I've seen their slogan around town ""Voted #1 for Ribs"" so we were excited, but after taking our first bite into those saucy ribs, we looked at each other and said ""meh"" as we have had better. The chicken on the other hand, drenched in BBQ sauce, was interesting. It was saucy yet crispy so it was an interesting dish, we probably favor the chicken over the ribs. The family meal is large so make sure you have plenty of mouths to feed, as for us we'll need to hit the gym for the next several days to burn off the calories we just packed on."
q0cL9c_IQPjaGFIA64COFA,Worst food I've ever had the laziest service. We ended up throwing 35 dollars in the trash. If you like getting sick or experience all time lows check this place out!
tBtVsv9M__Zl4xqQ7xN9AQ,"Hot Sauce Williams is a Cleveland institution... Put in other words- you have to try this place at least once. 

The sauce isn't for everyone. It's a vinegar based sauce with a little heat to it. I absolutely LOVE it but I know others who prefer a thicker sauce. I normally go with the 2 piece all white dinner with the sauce on everything. The fried chicken is some of the best in Cleveland. The fries, slaw and bread are all solid and for what you pay ($6.99 for my meal) you get a ton of food. The inside of the restaurant is very old school-- definitely not a place for suits and ties. It has a drive thru which is super convenient, especially considering the area it is in."
qr9hC5-YKLjMBBT-DJ8Vow,"My good friend, a native Clevelander, described this spot as a Cleveland staple. In town for a Cavs game & we gave it a try! 

My BF & friend had the pork shoulder & it looked great. They loved it, I tried it & wished I ordered it. It's on white bread & looks a little mysterious but it's delish. I ordered the chicken ...I waited....& waited for this stupid chicken. My friends & BF were done eating by the time I got my chicken *sigh* not cool. Luckily I got my sides first which were mac n cheese (dry and tasteless) and greens (ok). I was so excited for this place & what a bummer. The chicken was juicy but had no flavor. I am a white girl that grew up in Pittsburgh, I'm not asking for much in terms of flavor but my God this was tasteless. 

Let's touch on the location, def off the beaten path. I felt as if I were at a fire hall. The decor reminded me of a low budget bridal shower. It's positively outdated which is fine, it's a dive. I wish the food made up for the detoured drive, long wait & weird set up."
91fnUQiklT741ypgwrNw-w,"Pretty solid / cheap chow.
But not BBQ
Line moved fairly slow but i didn't expect fast food.
Staff was polite and playful

I ordered the chicken/ribs combo. ($10)
-The chicken was pretty tasty, but the sauce poured all over it made it instantly soggy.
-the ribs are smoked/grilled then BAKED. that said they had good flavor and texture.
-the sauce is just plain not good. tastes like sweetened tomato juice.
it worked okay on the ribs but ruined the chicken.
-mac n cheese is meh
-greens are cooked sweet. not my style.

Def work a quick meal if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way."
1cnIDaTYinT2BNOD8aqCdw,The polish girl was good overall but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. The fried chicken was also a plus.
gClPOdeAxVdcJByX5W5ojw,"I have been going here for at long time and its one of few places I can overlook bad service because I love the food. The wings are great, best wings in Cleveland but the best offering from here is the barbeque sauce. Better service and it would be 5 stars."
0uZXvWjKqpYBI8n-eNU8RA,"I like to do Man vs. Food tours whenever I visit a city for work, and while planning for Cleveland, Hot Sauce Williams and their Polish Boy definitely made it onto my list of must eats. Man oh man, it did not disappoint. That Polish Boy is AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of your typical hotdog with coleslaw, not so much hot sauce or putting fries on things. But I'm telling you, this thing is spot on! The hot sauce wasn't too hot, the fries melded together with everything else in a special and tasty way, and the slaw and kielbasa were delicious. You have to try it if you get the chance. No wonder it's a signature Cleveland food. 

I did do the drive thru (after reading other reviews this white girl didn't want to risk going inside by herself late on a Saturday night) but didn't have any issue with a long wait - maybe 3 minutes tops. Glad there were no harassing panhandlers around either. I was bummed they were out of banana pudding but the strawberry cheesecake was ok. 

Bottom line: go get yourself a Polish Boy!"
n_mIIi1mNSqyOGGNEI9Q8w,"All I can say is that both the food and the restaurant were completely disgusting. The pork shoulder tasted like it was two weeks old and reheated in a microwave. Their fries were cold and mushy. The cole slaw was the only edible thing they gave me. The whole meal was so bad I threw it in garbage after two bites. To go along with the terrible food the inside of the restaurant was dirty and had a strange smell. It's probably not necessary to say, but I will never set foot in Hot Sauce Williams again."
h4XxiPjntIPhjFAFegQh9Q,Hot Sauce Williams takes the best BBQ in Cleveland in my option. The home made mac and cheese is astonishing. The chicken is drenched in sauce and you just have to saver the flavor. I love to lick my fingers clean to finish off my meal.
t_JpuqPSeeBpDpWRKb-zFg,"Painful to watch this slow disorganized mess try to handle just a few orders at once. Took 30 minutes to get our food and that was because we accepted other chicken pieces than what we ordered because they said it would take longer. Short story long: if you're in a hurry this isn't the place for you.

On a positive note; the ribs were very good even with a little too much of their hot sauce on them. But the ribs weren't incredibly meaty. The chicken was nicely fried, but they put a bit too much hot sauce on it. The fries and mac and cheese were good with the hot sauce. 

An odd mix resulting in a 3 star experience"
EM1aHX7DsSAKDoqYOocyTw,"The chicken isn't what makes this place great.  It's good but it becomes something different entirely when you smother it in the signature sweet, juicy sauce.  My God, I'd smother my limbs in this and eat my own arms.  It's that good.  Get that and some of the mac n cheese and you're in heart attack heaven.  But it's so good you won't care!  Also, all this crap about ""Oh i might get shot"" or ""Don't venture here at night"".  This is Cleveland, kids.  It's rough.  But I'd rather venture into a rough neighborhood than spend my time kickin' it at Applebee's in the safety and comfort of some designed suburb eating crap ass Jack Daniel glazed ""riblets.""  Do yourself a favor, venture out of your comfort zone and get some good chicken...and extra sauce  You'll be super happy you did."
QPa95SRzS7JrrCtENK9l2w,"This is probably going to be one of my favorite places that I stopped at on my cross-country trip...thanks yelpers for letting me know it's worth going to the shadier part of cleveland (which isn't THAT bad) to get my grub on.

The two things you have to get when you go to this joint are the macaroni and cheese (my husband says it's the best he ever had and he's a snob when it comes to fatty foods) and the fried chicken (this was so juicy and flavorful on this inside and deliciously crispy on the outside). OMG, seriously run there is you have the privilege of being in Cleveland. 

Oh, and a few other pointers:
Cornbread was not good at all.
I didn't try the coleslaw because it was super lathered in mayo.
We also had the pulled pork sandwich, which was really good too. The bbq sauce is flavorful, but not hot at all. I liked it on the pork, but I'm glad I didn't get the fried chicken drenched in the sauce - better on its own."
yUo2luFZRp9_oqRE_6hvjA,"I know others have been moaning about their service, but our experience last Sunday was great. 

We were disappointed about the dining room being closed, but the drive through was open and the staff were very patient with our endless debate about what to order (our son can be finicky). They even chimed in with recommendations when they told us that Fried Okra was unavailable.

The food was incredible -- and really messy in the car as we scarfed it down on our way back to NYC. We had Polish Girls, Mac and Cheese, Black-Eyed Peas and a Pork Shoulder sandwich. The sauce is really special. 

We strongly recommend it to everyone. Great food, great service, really cheap."
9aCTKXLxKTNBJEhpXUY-1g,"This is a funny place.  Being from Youngstown, and not Cleveland, I went here after my Cleveland Clinic appointment, because I saw this place on Man vs Food.  I went there for one reason only...the Polish Boy.

The service staff was really under-enthused to wait on me...even though I was only 1 of 4 people in the whole joint.  The 1st lady who I said hi to pointed me in the direction of the stack of paper menus, without saying anything back to me.  

The Polish Boy, was not on it.  But after asking the lady at the counter, they DO still have it available.  It's a kielbasa on a bun, topped with fries, coleslaw, and BBQ sauce.  The TV show also added pork shoulder to the sandwich, but for some reason, they didn't put it on mine.

It was awesome nonetheless.  

The place was a dive, doesn't look that clean, and it's located in a not-so-great side of town, and the service was lacking any personality.  However, the Polish Boy was GREAT.  I would definitely have this again.  I hear their other food is good too, but the PB is all I wanted.

3 stars for the food.  0 stars for the service.

Letter Grade:  B"
VzP7FDWc9YwWihxR59rDpQ,"I wont lie.. I was a little scared to enter this restaurant. I have always wanted to eat here but the location on Lee has a horrible reputation for .. well if haven't heard.. picture the scene from Animal house when they all walk into the bar where Otis is playing.. Nuf said. 
I had heard that Man Vs Food was at this location, so i figured i would give it a shot. Upon entering most places the food network has been you will notice that not only do the places raise their prices, but pictures and plaques are everywhere commemorating the event. Had you not seen the episode, you would never know they had been there.. Its as if they couldn't have cared less.. 
So i asked the girl.. ""Whats good""  and with out even hesitation she fires back ""You gotta try the polish girl and you might as well have the fried chicken too.."" With that type of certainty.. i had to reply ""Well. OK!"" She then asked me ""You want our sauce on your chicken?"" To which i asked "" I dont know, do i?"" She promptly said yes and ladled it on. For those who dont know.. A polish girl is a sausage (hot dog like) on a bun with french fries, pulled pork, coleslaw and their sauce.. Its about as good of a sandwich as you will ever taste. 
Now fellow Yelpers.. I have been known to exaggerate a little to heighten the effectiveness and entertainment value of a good story.. But i say to you today.... That is the best fried chicken that has ever passed my lips. The very wise and helpful woman who took my order was appreciated ever time i took a bite of that chicken. That sauce.. complimenting an already outstanding chicken breast.. I well up with tears just thinking about how unbelievably good that food was. 

On another note.. Buy a F*cking mop already.. The place is absolutely deplorable. I needed rubber gloves and a hasmat suit to enter the place. Seriously... what is that 10 years of grime on the molding? Its absolutely disgusting. How you havent been sited is beyond me.. Perhaps people are so blinded by the food (as i was) that they don't notice or care. You would have had 5 stars, but i just couldn't get over how dirty it was.."
2FJ_j0d4jY1hA65v94vc0w,"I had always seen this place growing up, but I never actually tried it until this past Christmas! The fried chicken was probably the best I have ever had; worth every calorie! I had the sweet potato fries and they were great and crispy.  Everyone was really nice; the cook even came out and took a photo with us when I told him that I was visiting and had always wanted to try the place! I will definitely be coming back!"
ZUysgXDo-0nv4ZAl2CE4WA,"Um, can I just say that I want another 15 orders? This stuff is so so delicious. It has had rave reviews from all sorts of TV shows and I had to try. So last night, after a full weekend of eating, I decided I could just put on some super loose eating pants and go and get my fill. 

We ordered the rib tip meal and the thigh snack. The rib tips were well cooked and the SAUCE! That is the winning ingredient. The ribs themselves were a little bit tough at times, but that sauce is really what makes your mouth water. We also got the macaroni and cheese as a side and as a not usual fan of mac and cheese (I KNOW, I'm the devil for saying such ludicrous things) I wasn't expecting to finish the ENTIRE tub by myself. My boyfriend wished he acted faster, because he just got a small taste. 

What you have to be careful about when you go late at night is that they close the doors and you have to order in the drive through. The intercom doesn't work so you drive up to the window and order. They take about 5 to 8 minutes to get your order. During that time, there will be homeless people that approach you. If that's not your scene, you won't score some awesome ribs. The environment its in is not great, but the food will surely make you want to come back."
nXVeJxHQ_-vBYIO61lNqUw,"Forget about the place and service (which were fine) and let's talk about the food!  The Polish Boy was good, but the fried chicken was AMAZING!!  And the sauce was killer!"
4wGo32rPfWCt7J6S61pdzg,"So torn. I love their food. We wanted a polish boy. Yelp says open until 1:30, it is 10:26 pm and drive thru dude says they're closed. What? If you're normal and visit during normal hours, I gave hsw 5 plus stars. But consistence is nice too."
9gwDQXFyjNuZpY0FfZ4_Ag,"The chicken and po boy was amazing. Possibly the best I ever had. Get it with the sauce loaded on the chicken and fries. Staff was super friendly. 

I will come back next time I am in the neighborhood I visited because it wAs a nice walk from the Cleveland clinic. Probably not the best idea at night but during the day it was great."
hEeajeUzkW2wABDE4SXF2A,"The food is good but the service is slow.  This means do not go there for a quick to go food.  I ordered a side of ""mac and cheese"" and fries.  The ""mac and cheese"" was already prepared but it took them 20 minutes to get my fries.  There was no sense of urgency amongst the entire staff, they just assumed everybody came to spend their entire day in the restaurant waiting for food."
jjj5tomYOQt1ZBVE67eOTA,"Hot Sauce Williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine :) My favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner. For sides, I get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. They give you sooooo much food for just under $12! 

The servers work only behind the food stand, so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself. You may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness, but the food is so worth it!  One thing to keep in mind, they don't provide free water, but a bottle of water is only $1. 

Definitely worth checking out!"
79NLGMAGH8DVHcWvj1DIPg,Loved this spot! I got the pork plate which is shoulder with slaw and bread covered in sauce. Came with fries that I had them add sauce to. Just amazing. I've had bbq so many ways and I appreciated how unique and delicious this spot was!
CR4r0GkyYxK5FP7EaFEOgg,I went here on my lunch break and I waited for 20 minutes just for a polish boy! It was pretty good but waiting for the very slow and rude staff was frustrating.
pHZqrQnoYFjAPpUZywf--g,"My son and I stopped here on our way home from vacation. I wanted a polish boy, but Seti's is closed on weekends. This place had a good rep for theirs. I had the polish girl (polish boy with pork shoulder). It was tasty, but didn't think its size justified its price. Paid over $9 for something noticeably smaller than a regular hot dog. Yeah, it had fries and a can of soda, but still.....The sauce was good, but don't expect it to be hot. We waited a long time in an empty restaurant for anyone to come up to the counter to take our order. She saw us, but kept wandering around not really doing anything. Seemed like they were out of everything. No chicken sandwich, no corn fritters, no fried chicken breasts, and a few other things the people behind us ordered. The woman taking our order acted like we were bothering her and that she was doing us a huge favor by doing her job. There was a cheap boom box blaring awful music you coudn't get away from no matter where you sat. I don't care one way or the other about decor, but if you do, don't go here. Table cloths look like cheap shower curtains a 4yr old picked out, and there is a cheap entertainment center in the dinning room. Who puts an entertainment center in the middle of a restaurant, lol? All in all, the food tasted good, but wasn't the best value, the service was crap, and the decor was laughable."
YJhSfekObpQ-rBPmCKaZMA,"If you don't like this place, chances are you don't know what good barbeque is.

I had the rib tip dinner (Off menu btw). This is a good alternative to the full rib dinner. It is still a ton of food, but not quite as much! The sauce is delicious.

As of 27 Feb 2011, you get a free plastic Pepsi 'Courtesy Cup' if you buy any one of their sodas.

Yes it's dirty, informal and right in the middle of an extremely sketchy neighborhood. IMO Cleveland needs more places like this. There are way too many places that wish with all of their might to be located in Manhattan or LA. Guess what? You're in Cleveland. Now ditch the valet and the uppity atmosphere, and give me some food."
zIB6nQ8EL8sQqlRDFUxJHg,"Where do I start....My family & I went here on Saturday night and ordered 2-4 piece chicken dinners & 1-2 piece chicken dinner.  We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait!!!  The chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh, drumstick coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about  heaven!!!! You can get the sauce on the side though if you're not too adventurous. 

Now the service, that's another story.  Let me just say they need a tutorial on  customer service.  I'm a person who believes in second chances, so we tried this place again on Sunday and the service was the same....The only thing that changed was the table cloths?.....The reason why I gave this place a 4 star is because of the food but the service could use a lot of upgrading!!!

I would suggest that you call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food, it's like watchin' paint dry!!"
DM0Y5vKoIH8myhsm6tnvJg,"oh God....I think this may be my first review where I add the tag line ""for Cleveland""....I'm so sorry that I have to use it here...

So, this is decent BBQ....for Cleveland.

Decided to commemorate MLK Day and a former Yelper by patronizing Hot Sauce Williams.  We had both been wanting BBQ all day long and figured today was just a good a day as any to give it a shot.  Reading the previous reviews, I found it quite funny that we wound up getting the exact same thing as Amy T. and her dining partner!  Ribs, coleslaw and fries for me...4 pieces of fried chicken, mac and cheese and fries for my gluttonous dining partner ;o)

But, getting to the point of ordering was an ordeal in itself!  We walked in and there were no menus posted....looking around for a couple of minutes, I was almost ready to go up to the girl behind the counter and ask her ""so, what do you think we should get""...but I was kind of afraid to do that because of the response I envisioned in my head *cringe*.  So, I was pretty thankful when we finally looked around and found some printed up menus of their offerings....but, in what kind of order did they put these things?  There was no rhyme or reason to half of the menu, very confusing.

Ordering was an event in itself, I started ordering with one girl and then she just walked away in the middle of my order, and then another chick came up and kind of finished it....I mean, I agree with Stef C. on this one, would it kill you to put a smile on your face and actually act like you enjoy getting paid??

Pluses, it was cheap, and it was fast, we had our food in less than 5 minutes and were out the door to enjoy it at home.

Portions were HUGE, holy crap you could feed a family of four on the two dinners we ordered, neither of us could finish our meals.  Sauce was decent, ribs were a little grisly, chicken was pretty good....but in all reality, eating BBQ in Texas and Georgia has ruined me.  HSW is decent BBQ, for Cleveland.....this place would be out of business so fast in any of the Southern states due to the attitude you receive behind the counter and for the simple fact that it's just not that great when compared to some of the great BBQ places around the country.  

Let's just say I think my BBQ craving is over until summer comes around and all the Yelpers can get together and do a proper cookout."
IZpHJ73Ai6daF7VJTBfWqw,"There is a lot of buzz about this place, especially given its feature on the Food Network. Having lived in New Orleans for some time, I was both curious and eager to give HSW a try. (New Orleans is famous for some of its fried/comfort foods.)

The Bottom Line: this place is rather magical. If you love fried food that is slathered in hot sauce, then this is your place. To be honest, the fried food offers a one-dimensional taste experience; however, the food presentation is beautiful...in an ordered-chaos sort of way.

There's a menu, but you pretty much just get whatever they have available (I.e., whatever is sitting in the warmers behind the counter). I tried the fried chicken and the famous Polish Boy sandwich -- a fried kielbasa topped with coleslaw, fries, and hot sauce. I also ""sauced"" everything, allowing the kind worker to paint all of my food with the ever-so-sweet-tangy-and-delicious HSW hot sauce. The food was hot, and amazingly, the chicken was as crispy/tasty as some of the famous fried chicken of New Orleans' Willie Mae's Scotch House and Dooky Chase. (Huge success!)

The decor is the best part of HSW. The restaurant is appears to be a bit rundown, ostensibly dirty, and some of the windows are adorned with iron bars/mesh for safety purposes. While this may seem to be a negative, it is not. These details, coupled with the ambiance of the restaurant's neighborhood, offer the adventurous and hungry an authentic City of Cleveland dining experience.

Grade: A"
f6lZEx4g8qj-beIv-jPnGA,"Decided that I had to check this place out since I am a huge fan of Adam Richman and he featured it on Man vs Food. He also wrote a section on Cleveland in his book, 'America the Edible', and he name drops this spot. 

My fiancee and I were not disappointed, it definitely hit the spot. I loved the sauce. Ryan tried the Polish Boy which basically a kielbasa, with sauce, and cole slaw piled on top. The french fries are smushed in on the side, but definitely a tasty experience overall. I heard that the wait on the ribs was 30 minutes so I opted for their fried chicken which was crunchy greasy goodness. For a fairly quick bite I definitely recommend checking this place out."
SGxZizLl1l_enqADtFZUnQ,Came here on Saturday evening and there was a line about 10 people in front of me. I ordered a 3 pieces white dinner and was expected to get my food within 10-15 mins; however it took me about more than half hour to get the food. It's fair to say that efficiency was not their priority. Despite the service the food was absolutely amazing. Great value with great taste. The chicken breasts were tender and not too oily. The sauce was top natch.
sCwDTs4YOoDOF7ikeOWLXQ,"Solid BBQ spot- definitely recommend! 
Pros: Reasonably priced and delicious. 
Cons: Food was pre-prepared and clearly sitting out a while before we got there. 

The taste and flavor are outstanding! I kept it simple and ordered Ribs and fries. Sauce had me like ""mmmmmm mmhhhmmmm"" and ribs were like ""Ahhhhh yaaa ahhhhh."" Great time had by all!"
iyEMjTgHEHjfGOwhS73Azg,This place was extremely unorganized. Orders came out slowly and at least half of it was wrong. The air conditioning must have been broken on our visit because it was over 90 degrees in the dining area. The food was pretty good and the only thing keeping this review from getting a one star. We ordered the rib tip sandwich but they came back 15 minutes later and said they were out so we ended up getting the pulled pork. While the food was good ( I would I say 8 out of 10) it wasn't nearly good enough to overcome the disappointment. We won't be back.
GjvWN7Yco0BKFSL7Alhwyw,"Got the chicken and ribs dinner with green beans and fries. All delicious. Pretty much as close to being in the south as you can get in Cleveland.  Served in foam carry out trays, fancy. The only thing lacking was the service but really I expected that."
zWM-bQ3h-o4ku6uYHRn2ww,"I decided to stop by here to try the Polish girl sandwich featured on Man vs. Food.  The sandwich was tasty but the service is terrible. 

Like others have said in there reviews, the service is extremely slow.  The waitresses walk slow, talk slow, and were inattentive.  It also took almost 30 minutes to get one polish girl and fish sandwich (because they ran out of the popcorn shrimp my friend wanted...) which is pretty slow to me.  Our waitress even disappeared during the middle of our service and it took us a extra 20 minutes to get our bill after we were done.

The restaurant is also an eyesore, the pink and light blue color scheme is even more offensive to the eyes in person.

I won't ever come here again but if you plan to come here, order to go!"
wVbQxPcDYSIK62jmQo-axA,I shamlessly admit to straining that tin foil that comes with my rib order like a rag to get more of that tasty bbq sauce.
gX5hhgPQlmS6hfEICV_jug,"This place is oh so tasty!!  The great thing about their chicken is that, you don't even need their hot sauce for it to taste so good.  With the hot sauce, the chicken goes from good to great.  The pieces of chicken are typically big, hot, and filling.  Truly hit the spot if you're wanting a taste of the south, up here in Northeast Ohio.

The only problems I had with this place was that they close the dining room in the afternoon on Sunday (luckily they have the drive thru open) and the sides aren't seasoned well enough.

Overall, this place is must try place."
iXkiIxr2V5QtdLLQlULQDA,"Manager, please delete this review after owner of Yelp has read . . . Thank you.

Well, let me tell you.  I love he food here!  However, I had a costly-to-owner and manager, and a terrible experience today (well, the 12th a Wednesday), and they need to know if they want to keep customers!!!  Who knows how many people just walk out because of the rude and slow staff - I'm sure they do it all the time and just don't tell the boss.  Here is what I am trying to communicate, and I can find no other way.  Website non-existent.
 
My would-be communique:
You lost 3 customers in a row today, August 12, at about 4:30, including the 2 ahead of me and then me.  I would have spent around $20.  The two were mother and son, and who knows what a growing boy eats?!  
The 2 in front of me (no one else in line or the restaurant) waited and waited even to be acknowledged let alone waited on.  There were 3 employees - a man and 2 women -who saw clearly we were there.  The customers and I chatted pleasantly for a good 5 minutes.  They got tired of waiting - for anything.  They left.  I was now the only customer.  One would think that their seeing 2 walkouts would have prompted them to action!  
The 3 of them stood directly in front of me at the register!  They did everything to pretend I wasn't there.  Could they not have said ""we'll be right with you""?  Totally ignored me and instead counted tickets and chit-chatted about.  There was plenty of food, so they were in no crunch.  I'd have spent $20 - LOSS.  Mother and son, who knows? - LOSS.  I go to your place because it's usually great and I am a frequent Clinic visitor.
Frankly, I would fire all three of these employees if I were you.  You've got a great business, but who knows how many customers walk out.  RUDE EMPLOYEES might be chasing away more than you know.  
Susan Bednar"
PUkpeN3cZBzEBg0LZEN_BQ,"Went late evening...door was locked this time. (Wasn't locked the last evening I went.) Parking lot full of cars that's not at restaurant. So I go to the drive thru, there's a piece of card board on the speaker that says nothing (very unprofessional.) Sat there a few minutes not knowing what to do. Went to the drive thru and placed order there. Prices were a lot more than the prices listed on line which is what I was prepared to pay. 

Between the drive thru speaker and not keeping up on current prices on their website, seems like they just don't care. So for now on I don't care to patron. I'll take my business elsewhere to someplace that shows the customer they care and stay professional. I'm not going to keep patronizing places that doesn't have any sort of professionalism about them. There are tons of restaurants of there!"
b1nJMO8UAfgmRBu1Xf846g,"I found the ribs here underwhelming, they tasted a little overcooked and tough.

However, fried chicken is really good here. Not overly breaded, perfectly fried, and the chicken itself is warm and tender. Get the sauce on the side, since I'd imagine you are getting takeout and the last thing you want is the chicken to turn into a sloppy mess by the time you get home. 

Wait times have been surprisingly long (on the order of 20 - 30 minutes) despite how there is almost no line. If you come here hungry and stare at the food while waiting, this will be torture. At least they give you so much food that it still amazes me to this day how they actually manage to fit it in the takeout box.

Eating here regularly is ill-advised, if nothing else because I would prefer to not require the services of the world famous (and strategically close) Cleveland Clinic cardiologists and cardiac surgeons."
OrP2zt67MSMWpaIkjA1y2A,By far the greatest place to visit. Been a fan for twenty years and until you come here you aint had real BBQ
zbkLv0HYXVTfgxnw-lt_tQ,"My fiancé and her friend got food poisoning last night. They ordered the beef ribs... Not fun and not good. I got the fried chicken which was great and i feel ok. Service is kind of shitty like other reviews have said, some people are just not positive. I guess i wouldn't be working at a BBQ place till 1:30 in the morning. I will NOT be going back. Food poisoning is a really bad thing, which means they aren't doing proper food handling."
wv2M1L3dhDSaauUl0mMeOg,"Delicious Fried Chicken! Though the name is Hot Sauce Williams Barbecue Restaurant, this is the place to get fried chicken not ribs. Their ribs are so so to me. The fried chicken, however, is heavenly. Their sauce is wonderful too but I always get it in a cup and put on the chicken sparingly cause the chicken is top notch without it. The crust is perfect. After eating chicken here Popeyes, Churches and the rest of those national franchises' chicken taste awful to me. Love their excellent down home side dishes too. Four stars and not five because of the ho hum customer service (sometimes) and poorly put together menu. A side note, no matter what time I come into this place the clientele is always around 60 percent Black and 40 Percent White, with more Whites eating in the restaurant and a higher percentage of Blacks taking out."
9R5D8tbFTUpuDi7xwCHl3A,"It seems they care about their food. Tried a polish boy (it's food, I swear). It had great taste but messier than a Hollywood divorce..with kids. Couldn't be happier with the hot sauce, chicken and ribs. Ton of food for a little money. No public restrooms, fake flowers on pink tablecloths in an old fast food joint. They still yell their orders to the back. So why are they on the travel channel? They actually care about their food."
zMuK1UEb79fgPFJFsBI9NQ,"WHAT HAPPENED??  A year ago I would recommend anyone visiting Cleveland to come here.  NOT AFTER TODAY!!  I used to LOVE going here!  The Polish boy was one my personal favorites.  Today, I was on my way home and just happened to come by Hot Sauce Williams so I pulled in.  I knew I would have to wait at the drive thru but ...WOW!  15 minutes??  I should have just parked my car and went in.  Drive Thru is a BAD IDEA at this establishment.  I pulled up to the speaker and a piece of cardboard was over the speaker and written in marker saying ""STOP! Order here!"" I ordered and I will come to find out that the prices on their outside menu are WRONG and MORE EXPENSIVE than listed! (I didn't know this but I will explain later). On top of that, it looks like the window covering the menu and prices has not been cleaned since 2012. I ordered the Polish Boy combo and small size fried okra.  I had a couple in front of me and waited approximately 5 minutes before I arrived at the window ( I made a mental note changing radio stations because when I arrived at the window it took longer than the entire song of Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' as I kept changing stations to pass times and ended back on the 80's channel to hear the end of that song and start a new one).  Do not think of this place as a typical 'fast food' drive thru.  You order and you will WAIT but they don't tell you that which can be a good thing.  This can give you the impression that the food is fresh but to tell you the truth, it didn't seem like it was 'fresh' in least bit.  In fact, it appeared that they took care of of whoever was inside BEFORE the drive thru customers because I actually watched 3 polish boys being made while I waited for my single polish boy because I guess the people inside took priority and they had only ONE person making food with 3 other people handling money and passing out beverages.  While watching someone else's food being prepared another employee came to the window and gave me my ridiculous total of $11.98!!  I gave her my money and at first I just simply thought the tax was high so I asked why my total was $11.98?  Apparently the prices listed on their dusty and dirty outside menu board are WRONG!  The RUDE employee didn't tell me anything.  She just ""handed"" me a receipt.  Instead of the okra being $2.75 it was $3.99!  I told the lady this and she just said, ""It is?  I will have to change that.""  She walked away and I NEVER saw her again. Well, what about you OVERCHARGING??  I was already upset waiting for food so I turned my car off to save gas until I arrived at the window. I was overcharged and the lady avoiding me now, had another employee hand me my beverage. Coke in a can. As I was saying my food was over charged, she closed the window!! WHAT!! This is how you deal with customers with issues!?!? You AVOID them! 
     Finally I received my food.  They had ANOTHER employee hand me the food and this worker was a male.  I was actually able to talk with him and say that I was overcharged. He was not helpful or even courteous in ANY way! He said, ""I can't help you, I don't work with the menu."" I kept telling him, this was WRONG, you can't overcharge customers and you can't treat people like this! Again, like a robot, ""I can't help you with that.""  I heard enough. ""If you can't fix this or help and NONE of you are willing to help without me making a scene then I'm DONE with ALL of you!"" He replied again, ""I can't help you"" and shut the window then walked away while all the other employees avoided the window. 
     I'M NEVER RETURNING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!! What happened?? The employees don't care! A year ago this was a decent place! They even have photos of Robin Williams (I miss him so much!) visiting there with his family.  What happened? I don't know and I WISH I could give this place more stars but this whole experience was enough for me to give them the LOWEST rating. I had a few good times here in the past with some memorable moments but it will ALWAYS be overlooked by this horrible treatment! THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS TREATMENT AND ATTITUDE! Even the food changed in my opinion. My Polish Boy was a regular sized hot dog with fries and coleslaw slapped on top of it and my fried okra was soggy.  Worst of the all, the sauce was different this time too. It was watered down and tasted old if that's possible. I WILL NOT RETURN."
UlH1vcIaTGaoMNXeU8hKaA,"Sweet merciful Fried Chicken and Polish Boys!

It is absolutely delicious food."
p-27femPsz2zvenUsCXh8A,"Good fried chicken and sides.  I had tried some of their ribs at the Taste of Cleveland last year though, and wasn't too impressed since the meat was a little tough and the sauce, just OK."
8Mg5n8kUeCofQFa37EmNiw,"Mrs. Doubtfire was here!

No really Robin Williams dined at this location.  

The Fried chicken is crunch in your mouth drippy kind of good!   My favorite meal is the polish girl.  it just screams ""Eat Me!!""    polish dog piled high with pulled pork, crinkled fries drenched in slaw and oh so good tangy HSW sauce.   Oh how the sauce enhances the taste, Makes you want seconds

Now when you eat your hot Polish Girl, you have to be gentle it tends to get sloppy.  I ease on into it.  I always end up with a mess on my hands and face.  wipe down needed after this Feast.  Sometimes I settle for the polish boy, a little less mess and take it all in kind of treat 

""Ease on into it"""
p9vooRGunX57oWrVAML3Jg,"I stopped in here today to get a chicken wing dinner for my wife.  After it took this young lady 10 minutes to take my my order.  She tells me its going to be a few minutes on the wings to cook.  So I had time to look around at all the celebrities to visit this staple in Cleveland.  I also had time to see how ran down and dirty this place was.  Dirty tables, floors, and walls.  Ceiling falling apart.  It's obvious they don't put money back into this dilapidated falling building.  30 minutes past I finally get my order.  The older lady gives me my order.  I asked don't I get a drink with my platter.  She told me it doesn't come with a drink.  I know the last time I was here I got the same thing and I got a drink with my food.  Matter fact this time I got coleslaw.  Last time I didn't.   Bottom line I'm all for supporting my community, but if you can't do better I'm taking my money elsewhere. But I'll give you another star because my food was good."
3UEaQRfF3ZK1nRRR2UfZaw,"Lovely, beautiful, and crowded. I didn't actually shop, just walked through and looked around, but there is beautiful art all around. Don't miss out. 
If you need a break, come in here and just browse around. It's crowded, but for some reason, seems relaxing and calming."
xBsJ6bds60lA9gWdUNkRUQ,"All the shoppes at the Palazzo are expensive. This is like the Rodeo Dr of California or Oak Street in the Gold Coast of Chicago. It is not like at Ceasar's Forum shops where there is a lot more variety. 
I like to window shop here and wish for things I can not afford, but the sales people are very pleasant here. 
They offered water bottles while I shopped at Tory Burch's for a specific purse my daughter was raving about.
**Also important to mention is I was almost swindled into buying some ""sea-salt"" cosmetics from La Savon. It's nothing more than the other cosmetics sold in kiosks throughout Las Vegas and elsewhere...I was curious how they managed to have an actual store front shop. The woman there tried to sell me 2 bottles of makeup first for $599, then went to $199 in a matter of minutes to get a sale. I flew out of there as quick as I could. Thankfully my husband made some excuse to leave."
JV5_pD2GW_WQr_i3756Fcg,"A truly wonderful place to shop, whether you buy anything or not! But seriously, how, how, how could you NOT! 
With stores like Fendi, Dior Cosmetics (insert semi-orgasmic groan here), Tory Burch, Cole Haan and Michael Kors, it's heaven for a devoted shopa-alcho-holic like yours truly. 
A beautiful, fragrant atmosphere, it's just plain decadent to drift from beautiful shop to more beautiful shop, a nice solid martini in hand. 
Big plus that just may elevate The Shoppes At Palazzo over The Forum Shops At Caesars (at least for me) was the lack of small fry running amok. Maybe because there's no FAO or scary animatronic creatures, whatever the reason, it's great grownup fun! 
So, GO! Window shop, browse, buy, have a cocktail, enjoy!"
JhM2JhJRNDCyCE4MGUVMGQ,"Lovely mall BUT....Ditto the reviewer from Texas, BEWARE the multiple scam store fronts (in several of the Las Vegas malls) selling ""skincare"" at crazy high prices. 

Moderna Tea Shop appears to be a Teavana type store .....however..... I was offered a tea sample at the door (and a tiny bag with a Costco looking teabag in it) but the situation immediately segued into a highly pressured sales pitch for $700 (!) skin care. 

Do not let them drag you inside to close the deal. Skip the fast taking BS, politely decline, run if you have to. Stick with Sephora, where you can verify and review what it is that you're buying."
HWKeggquTVAKbLa2NRueIQ,Another one of my favorite places to shop in Vegas. I love the huge Victoria's Secret!!! Could spend entire day shopping here!
ulckDpcv-Jqm9MELDg4l2g,Large selection of high priced shops.  Looked like more people were just walking around rather than buying anything.
EIl4MZWlerVNQ-3qEBbf6Q,This gorgeous mall of shoppes in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas are pricey for sure but it's lovely to look at all the upscale items. There are a few shops here and there that won't break your bank - look for Basin (a great little soap shop that has only one other location and that's in Orlando) and Fresh (great cosmetics) and other beauty stores. Lovely restaurants and super clean throughout.
PVWRaL_gwevUE6IvGyL3kA,"It is connected to the Grand Canal shops at the Venetian. These shops are all high end and upscale. The only shop I could afford I think was Victoria's Secret. There is an antique bookstore that's interesting to look inside of. There were a lot if vacant spots so I'm not sure how well this place does. Nice to just stroll through. They need to consider putting in some affordable stores too, like the Grand Canal Shoppes.

I was fortunate to have eaten at Mainland when the shops opened. I miss that place. It had yummy noodle dishes. A bowl of noodles was a bowl of luck! ^_^*~"
_4zT8JYH1UFU5ihD0dJEpQ,"On a couple of occasions, we strolled through the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  The assortment of high end brands was satisfactory, but it was not all-inclusive.  For Chanel, LV, or other high end stores, you have to go across the street to the Mall.  The Shoppes at the Palazzo is well-decorated with marble floors and other fine textures.  If you do not like to gamble and have the means to shop at high end stores, this place is for you.  As a result, we usually stick to the slot machines!"
Lvz1uz9FENm5xeX-1po5rQ,"You have to be rich AND have lots of disposable income to shop here.  They really don't mess around though, there's some great high-end shopping available if you want it.  We went (my girlfriend dragged me) to Christian Louboutin and Barneys New York, which is supposedly 85,000 sqft of full priced shopping goodness.

Otherwise, it's your typical upscale Vegas ""mall.""  Reminds me of a super-blinged out Valley Fair.

The parking lot for Palazzo is neat, it has electronic signs everywhere displaying how many spaces are available on each level.  It still won't really help you find a space, but you get an idea of where to look at least. 

One peeve - there's an Illy gelato shop at the base of the escalators, right across from the waterfall.  A scoop of gelato and a cappucino costs $11 before tax - and if you decide to eat in, they charge you an additional $0.75 to sit down.  Seriously?  OK, it was a decent cappucino, but damn.  They could at least tell you they charge 75 cents to have you sit inside rather than outside.  It's not like they have hot waitresses serving you, oh wait, you have to go to the counter and serve yourself.  

What a deal!"
_m2D2SmciNCghu5as2RRhA,"Lovely lovely lovely. I spent some time at the Tory Burch store. Bought some darling flats and nearly broke out into a huge sweat. Man its hot in there. No air circulation at all. Next was the Michael Kors store AGAIN. This store is much smaller than the one at The Forum. Huge Burberry store with clothes, bags, shoes, scarves, EVERYTHING. great selection. The Chloé store was amazing as well.  But let me tell you what did it for me was the Christian Louboutin store. Beautiful selection. This mall is next to the Canal where all the gondolas are. Lovely area. The only thing was the floor plans of the stores were a little weird to follow."
IWuCXPMp8cYrePa3xYvAAQ,"Holy Cow, what fun here! Shopping is exquisite. I think I need 3 more jobs to pay for it, but hey, you're in vegas! Beautifully presented merchandise and spacious stores are filled with really high end designers and it's fun to just window shop if you want. I went into the Coach store and they offer many bags not found anywhere else so it was a nice store. It's nice to grab an ice cream cone and walk around to people watch and window shop, then return to reality! Fashion mall was great alternative with things I can actually afford :)"
RhJji1qPUEn74nvNTQCwQA,"I couldn't find a Yelp listing for Elton's so I'm reviewing it here. 
The store is tucked away on the upper level and I missed it the first time through the mall.  I could have bought everything in the store.  All of my favorite brands in one place including Mark Nason and Robert Graham.
I found a shirt that I had to have, but I was leaving early the next morning and it needed some alterations.  I purchased the shirt just before dinner at Postrio and between dinner and dessert courses I excused myself to pick up my perfectly altered shirt and made it back in time for dessert. 
Excellent service and fair prices.  Elton's will be a destination on my next trip back to Vegas."
9vtwck-gkt5DnqZAwXNpTQ,"WTF was that living gardens show about? It was the most boring shit ever. It was at the waterfall and apparently has multiple showtimes. 3 ladies dressed up as trees or some shit moving hella slow to classical music pretending to blossom. I can't believe a crowd of 100+ people actually showed up to watch it. Just glance by it if you ever come across it, window shop for a bit, then head to the casino. 

PS. Happy 100th review to me!"
_U4GkVHOHYjQv3YIrBKS_A,The Shoppes at at The Palazzo needs to monitor at least one of its merchants and that would be Moderna Tea!  Offered a tea sample and then plied with face cream.  The high pressure con man got my husband alone and convinced him to buy $1000. worth of face goop.  After we left the store we read the receipt that said no refunds.  What tea shop sells high end cream?  These guys are con artists and need to be stopped!
58EQypQFc2O_b4aBn3_3iA,"A calmer shopping scene than Forum Shops at Caesar or Fashion Show Mall and a good blend of couture boutiques to ready-to-wear, more accessible than Crystals and Wynn-Encore Esplanade. The Venetian setting remains classic and a unique experience. 

Favorites include Chloe, DVF, Poleci, Barneys. Stop by Espressamente Illy for a delicious espresso or cappuccino."
eD6fhDpalFPiumZloFy4Ig,"We wandered around here early one morning right after most of the shops opened.  The place was empty.  We seriously saw very few people as we walked around (I think they were all sleeping off their hangovers).  The fountains and umbrellas are pretty and make for pretty photos.  The shops are a mix of average to very expensive shops.  We walked in a few and the people were friendly enough.

There are some cafes and restaurants toward the far end (we were coming from the Venetian).  It's a nice place to take a stroll, but it's not shopping for the average person. 

Besides the central gardens/fountains, the place was pretty boring."
EuzX_E1qcA_ZPnN4qFUp4g,"Though the Palazzo shares much in common with the Venetian, the Shoppes are not among them. The Palazzo is far superior in their quality of stores...including Thomas Pink, 7 for all Mankind, and Fresh (some of my favorites). 

The Palazzo is well worth a visit for both the gambling and shopping. A great combination if you actually manage to take some money from the casinos (only to give it back at the shops)."
Q6DDqeteaGRy6xq6Nn9gUQ,"Another shopping center in Vegas where you can't afford anything, or can't justify at all spending that much money on stuff you don't need. 

The decor is nice, though."
qA5tXBHoJ3zK8s83P-tmWw,"Nice shops, and clean floors. Window Shopping is always fun. The employees are courteous. I would save the 10 Dollars though and not see the Dealership. Few cars are down there and you can peek in from the stairs and see everything. It was wasted 10 dollars in my book."
7nvyzRIpNnBF2V7O256EHQ,"I don't care if I can't afford the ultra steep priced, high end stores.  This is a beautiful venue, richly decorated with a smattering of lovely fountains.  It was so pleasing to the eye, and honestly, I love browsing through the shops that will never be in my price range.  Okay, so I should think positively and HOPE for a day where I could afford it, but short of that happening, I can still browse and let out an occasional oooooh and aaaaah.  The decor is divine !!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to spend more time here, but we just didn't have it to spend.......money or time, come to think of it.  Another plus, easy access to this place from the Grand Canale Shoppes.  Just occurred to me, I never got to see the actual Palazzo Hotel........just saw the shops.  Oh well, all the more reason for a return visit, right ??"
R2Swbtka7n6k3pEPWrZfUw,"If you're possibly of a darker complexion, casually dressed, and with a group of 10 (including young children), this ""security guard"" will follow you AND ask you what shop you're looking for when looking at the map. Mind you, there were other individuals looking at the map, but this ""security guard"" asked me specifically what store I'm looking for. I told her, I'm looking for a bathroom and proceeds to tell me where the nearest one is then she turns back around t WE WENT AS A FAMILY WITH KIDS."
nUPRe6A-5hdJNCP9CRGTXg,Beautiful Shops and Fabulous restaurants. The have valet and a parking garage. Easy access and beautiful place to shop.
Nlg2I08HlNH4oTW90a28YA,"Once again I prove to be a sucker for pretty, expensive stores even if I don't buy a thing! If I am lucky and happen to arrive in the middle of a sale, then I may end up the proud new owner of a Diane Von Furstenberg number. I adore her dresses, so having her shop here is enough to earn the Shoppes a solid four stars. The atmosphere is quiet and not over the top like some of the other high-end shopping experiences in Vegas. I have never seen it crowded, as it is a bit secluded and not part of a thoroughfare between casinos. If you are from out of town, it is a wonderful destination to simply escape the bustle of Vegas for a couple of hours. For me, it is a must-stop when I am on my window-shopping rounds, doing a shopping tour with visiting friends, or on the hunt for something I just have to have."
RQ-aA5rw7R_RHy14Dk7UAw,"Got to love this little shop! They have all your needs and wants! You can come here to get a few t-shirts or do a little shopping for the room. Everything from water to juices, to your adult cocktails to medicine! They have it all here.  They are open 24 hours and located right beside the hotel elevators!"
3UU-ULayjbCBB5_VGT9ZCw,"I was actually quite disappointed with the Shoppes. Compared to other casino shopping centers like the Forum Shops & the shopping attached to the Venetian next door, the Shoppes really doesn't offer many choices."
u5n67YyyLp3Fhio5Sza14w,"OK, I have to admit: as a guy, it takes a fair amount for a shopping area to impress me, much less warrant a full 5 of 5 stars. So, gents, let me explain why this is actually happening and to have a successful / fun / enjoyable afternoon with your lady in Las Vegas. 

Step 1: Regardless of where you're staying, suggest to them ""Today I think we should stop by one of the casino bars after breakfast and have some champagne. Then we'll game for a half hour or so after which we'll walk through the Palazzo and do some shopping"" - at which point she'll agree because you said the magic word: SHOPPING!

Step 2: Enact the plan - head down to the casino bar and ply her with mimosas or bellinis or whatever...so long as it has champagne in it, you're golden. Have a couple yourself. Gamble. Casually announce that you're off to do some shopping.

Step 3: Amble your way along to the Palazzo - if you come in through the front then walk through the casino, stop at a gelato shop, etc. Make it enjoyable. 

Step 4: Upon arriving at the Palazzo your jaw will drop (yes, even you, lowly non shopping gents) at the staggering displays therein. And so will your lovely lady's jaw drop. Stop at a couple stores and then announce that you need a refill. 

Step 5: Stop at the Double Helix Wine Bar and collect glasses of wine for your and your date / significant other.

Step 6: Tag along while they shop. You're now pleasantly buzzed and you'll find you don't hate it. 

Step 7: While shopping you'll invariably find something that (a) costs a little less than what she was expecting and (b) costs a bit more than what you were expecting. BUY IT. 

Step 8: The remainder of your trip to Vegas will be the best time of your life and you can pretty much do anything.

There you have it guys...I just showed you how to have THE BEST trip to Vegas with your lady / significant other. 

PS: You can use this unlimited times and your gal will ALWAYS want to go back to Vegas then."
pgyPhwk3lB1DxedDzygUUg,Beautiful place. Nice and simple with great art and service. They r connected with the Venetian so its really cool to walk over. Great for families. And they have a great view
8cWafCGRUJk9NN1O2-AWHw,Love shopping in Vegas! The Palazzo shops are great for everyone.  Just awesome to walk around and check out the decor.  Amazing place.
plEc1pD5w1xT5lSYHP8Bmg,"I have to agree with others.  The Shoppes lacks personality.  Comparing this place to the Shoppes at the Venetian is like comparing night and day.  They do have a bunch of high end shops but these stores are often available at places such as the Forum Shops, Bellagio, and Wynn.  Further, the stores here are pretty small (except for Barneys) and their other locations often have more stuff.  It's nice to walk around but if you're looking to make a purchase, head to one of the other casinos and do it there."
GvfLKfmlobAHg_q8UDNdog,i found the shoppes in the palazzo to be relaxing and great place to walk around and window shop. the only store i could actually afford to buy anything was the victoria secret store. i picked up some beautiful bras and bubble bath.
KltThhEpNDjzudhZ-JNYTA,"This is a beautiful upscale mall to shop in.  Even if your budget doesn't allow it, it's a great way to spend an afternoon window shopping.  A must see."
lH-vai07r0DX-ckGx3V_uQ,"I love this place - Tory Burch, Christan Louboutin, DVF, Catherine Malandrino, Jimmy Choo, 7 for All Mankind, Chloe, and Michael Kors, just to name a few.  Great place to window shop, though sometimes there are sales (watch out now!).

Great place to visit while the mister gambles.  I always hit up these shops, Venetian, Wynn, and the Fashion Show Mall."
X9xG6gAIeDUNV2G5NqweVw,"I kept getting lost!!!  This place is so freaking confusing.

Only place I actually purchased anything was the Fresh store. 

High, high end window shopping is just not my thing."
eMB0LADBRICc6nGIgtnZhQ,"Can't say I've ever liked a dentist until now. 

To start, the place is BEAUTIFUL. A very different look than you'd expect from your typical dental office. 

I came in for my annual cleaning and this office is down the street from my house. The exam room is awesome, they had a TV on the ceiling, X-rays much easier that what I was use to and many other gadgets that not only made my exam more pleasant but more accurate for the Dr. 

The staff are the sweetest people and super friendly from the receptionist to the tech assistant and the Dr himself.

Now 5 days later my teeth feel cleaner than ever.
Side note I've dreaded all my other cleanings due to the pain following it, not this time."
i1UzQV2-zgAwcG-yldi4ig,"My dental work has come from Dr. Greep for a few years now. I would absolutely recommend this dental establishment. Nice, clean, diligent, friendly, and smaller with one on one service."
jv8KTRfSLpXk-lscLExNFw,This is the best dental office I have ever been to. Dr. Greep is very professional. I had a lot of dental work done and he explained every step to me so I could understand. I didn't feel any pain. I highly recommend him.
_iw0IGlFZtPCqxP5xcsTIQ,"Wie schon erwähnt, rustikales und eher altbackenes Ambiente, aber gemütlich. Bedienung ist sehr freundlich. Wir hatten Pizza, die recht passabel war. Insgesamt kein Laden zum Schick essen gehen, Aber für eine Pizza zwischendurch eine Empfehlung."
k2WNspTH6Mazkz4dxeIf4g,"Bodenständige italienische Küche, eher rustikales unedles Ambiente, sehr freundliche, aber manchmal schnarchige Kellner, wenn der Chef noch nicht da ist. Finde es liebenswert und gemütlich, gehe immer wieder gerne hin."
BWCCewfflc2wI6AdPT8-Fg,Eine kleine und gemütliche Pizzeria mit leckeren Pizzen und Nudelgerichten. Gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis und freundlicher Service.
-R-OianhKSSuLiZ6mzR19g,Tolle italienische Küche in einer unscheinbaren Location in Stuttgart West. Sowohl Service als auch die Speisen sind super und das Preis-Leistungs Verhältnis ist mehr als gut! Gutschein wurde gerne angenommen und als Dankeschön gab es ein Grapa aufs Haus. Sehr zu Empfehlen!
bokbBFumrarDfaQwMoR9Bg,"Ein Vorurteil verwandelte sich bei dieser Pizzeria in eine absolute Überraschung. Wir sind schon öfter an dieser Pizzeria vorbeigegangen und ich habe über den Namen etwas die Nase gerümpft - Regenbogen, das klingt so nach schlechter 80er Jahre Taverne.

Drinnen ist es dann im ersten Eindruck auch ein bisschen, wie bei einer kleinen Zeitreise - allerdings nicht in die 80er, sondern in die 90er, in die mich gerade die Lampen und die Einrichtung zurückversetzten. Was ich aber sehr charmant fand, waren die Theaterfotografien an den Wänden.

Beim Service war ich am Anfang etwas verunsichert, weil der gute Herr wirklich finster gucken konnte, aber das verbesserte sich im Laufe des Abends merklich und jeder, der an unseren Tisch kam war immer höflich und professionell. Außerdem waren Getränke und Speisen immer unverzüglich an unserem Tisch, auch als es später am Abend sehr voll wurde - so lob ich mir das.

Das Essen war dann ein wahres Gedicht, angefangen beim Brotkorb mit frisch gebackenen Pizzabrötchen bis hin zur Nachspeise, was wieder zeigt, dass man sich nicht von Äußerlichkeiten abschrecken lassen darf. 
Auf der gemischten Vorspeisenplatte fanden wir ein Gedicht an italienischer Salami und Schinken sowie exzellentem Käse. Mein Bruschetta war ein frisch gebackener halber Pizzafladen mit frischen Tomatenstückchen, die ordentlich mit Knoblauch garniert waren - sehr lecker!
Die Hauptgerichte haben uns dann absolut überzeugt: Ich hatte frische Nudeln von der Tageskarte mit Steinpilzen. Die Nudeln waren einen winzigen Tacken zu al dente für meinen Geschmack, aber sie zogen noch etwas nach. Die Steinpilze in der Soße mit frischen Kräutern waren hervorragend. 
Aber das absolute Highlight war die Pizza: wie in Italien. Hauchdünner, geschmacklich hervorragender, knuspriger, aber nicht trockener Teig mit leckerem Mozzarella, der ordentlich Fäden zieht und frischem Belag, der die anderen Zutaten nicht erstickt. Ich bin sonst von Pizza nicht so leicht zu beeindrucken, aber diese war einfach ein Gedicht.
Der Tiramisu zum Nachtisch musste dann noch sein, obwohl wir eigentlich schon satt waren. Er hat den hervorragenden Eindruck des Essens noch unterstrichen.

Auch der Wein war hervorragend und mit 4,50 Euro für 1/4 Liter auch nicht besonders teuer. Insgesamt war das Preis-Leistung-Verhältnis (9 Euro für die Pizza, 10,50 Euro für die Nudeln) für die Qualität absolut angebracht.

Einer meiner Lieblingsitaliener in Stuttgart, wenn es mal eher gemütlich als schick sein soll."
nEejFLrC78aaEeu981RpuQ,"Erst war ich Nicht so überzeugt von der Pizzeria. Von außen eher unscheinbar. Als ich dann meine Pizza bekam war ich sehr überrascht. Die Pizza geschmacklich super. 
Die Bedienung immer freundlich und hilfsbereit. 

Ich gehe auf jedenfalls wieder hin."
O_ygKUhl7aRM1kAmShJgpw,"Unser erster und letzter Besuch: Leider müssen wir von einem Besuch der Trattoria Regenbogen im St. Westen abraten. Unsere Erfahrungen von Heute:
1. Aus dem Nebenzimmer zog Rauch zu uns rüber 
2. Wir kippten entsprechend das Fenster  kurze Zeit später stürmte der Kellner an uns vorbei und schloss es wieder
3. In der Vorspeise Vitello Tonnato fand sich ein Stück Plastik (3cm!). Ich gab das Plastikstück zurück, erhielt aber weder eine Entschuldigung noch einen neuen Teller  lediglich ein Oh. Darüber hinaus war das Fleisch nicht durch und schmeckte nicht gut.
4. Der Hugo war sehr wässrig und der Holunderblütensirup war ganz unten
5. Nach dem Bezahlen empfahl ich dem Kellner, doch künftig bei solchen Dingen wie Plastik im Essen zumindest einen Grappa oder Cappuccino anzubieten. Die Antwort: Nein, das machen wir nicht  ist menschlich, kann doch passieren."
NUuBQaL91ENdCk4J9yZCHw,"Well this place WAS a good location to get a nice spray tan, and they regularly offered plenty of packages and discounts, but unfortunately they closed their doors unexpectedly last week.  I have been in contact with their corporate headquarters but have received no resolution, as they have been unable to secure the client list/information from the defunct location.  Needless to say, their lack of professionalism in closing their location so suddenly and the fact that I have money tied up in something I can no longer use is a bit irritating."
XizaZv0Juw9xZTeVoxKeFw,I agree with the other reviews. Staff was so unpleasant I only continued to go until my package expired. Will not return.
W4IQd--wXW0WDkSYAH6X7g,Just purchased a Groupon for this location and my experience was great! (And yes they do accept proof of Groupon if the voucher is on your phone). The girl at the front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable! She even offered a free upgrade for the stronger bed due to the fact that the bed my Groupon was good for had been occupied and would have required a wait time. Above and beyond customer service!
2v0IZTgXtjKA5bNlyKIsAQ,"Try to cancel a membership here and you quickly find they have a multi-level song-and-dance about why they keep charging your card.  It is rehearsed nonsense about why 3 different layers of management need to get back to you before they can fix an obvious mistake, but none of those people are ever around, or can return your call, or have other contact info, or ... you get the idea.

Do not trust them with your credit card info, and if you have made that mistake, just call your card and have them cancel any bogus charges.  They are familiar with these jokers and will save you the frustration of their runaround."
---g6CDTpsZqTYdcDoI2Hw,"I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011.  I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience.  

On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.  

I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.

I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.  

Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans."
IuJCVo84g8fgQOu9-ruYQg,"This place is terrible as far as hours go. On multiple occasions I came here during their normal hours, which are posted on the door and online, and they were closed. There was one occasion where the girl to open the door and didn't even address me. It was a half hour before closing time and 15 minutes before the last UV session was supposed to take place.  I eventually knocked on the door and she let me tan, but I was still annoyed because on another occasion, I went at 9:30 am, their normal business hours begin at 9:00, and there was no one in sight!"
VwuwD_UMM4oNF98URBQKrQ,"I can typically take or leave hotel restaurants as well, they are hotel restaurants.  Burnham is way different. 

On our last AM in town we were hitting breakfast before hitting 71 to go home. Anthony was our server. Two omelets with wheat toast, fruit for me potatoes for my BFF. Coffee. Juice. Ice Tea. 

What SOLD US and has us on Yelp and then Trip Advisor was my ask for ice water after I downed my coffee. Anthony turned around grabbed a glass, held it up and checked to make sure it was clean.  We went crazy - that NEVER happens but at the Burnham. When we praised him he said, ""I'm not gonna give out no dirty glass."" LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When he stopped by to pick up our plates he so proudly said, ""I love picking up dirty clean plates!"" BAWHAHAHAHAHA! Just absolutely too cute.  Lots of professionalism. Lots of personality.  Quite the impression. 

The food was perfect. The omelets were not in excess. Enough eggs and stuffing of our choice to balance it all out.  What an experience.  We hit so many breakfast places in town I'm sorry we didn't do this more than once. Thank you Anthony!"
ImIAoiDt-SUdzPG6K78sYg,The waiter was poorly trained and seemed unhappy with his job. Complained that Lebron was a bad tipper. Interrupted our business conversations.  Didnt give me a menu until i asked. We had bought 2 bottles of wine and he did not come back to refill.  Frankly I was a bit embarrassed hosting a business meeting there.  Food was unremarkable as well.
j-bvLvbgh4fIEcfFKRDHrQ,"I came to Cleveland to watch the cavaliers, raptors game the restaurant at the hotel was the burnham restaurant, we were all trying to figure out where to eat and we pulled the menu up on our phones and we decided this place. The service was some of the best I've had, My server Jeff was a very genuine guy, I've been to many restaurants where servers are nice, but it seems like it's a forced attitude, but I could tell Jeff even outside of work acted the exact same and was a joy to be around, The food was amazing too we tried a bit of everything and had no complaints about anything. Some of the food we had was the ""soul bowl"" which was pork belly on top of mac and cheese, the chicken wings confit, hangar steak, Buffalo chicken pizza, and a burger. I would get it all again, but the steak and the pork belly was my absolute 2 favourites, you have to try it out for yourself to see why I'm talking about!"
_lfkSTQ62kH8po5Z0T57og,"Came for my birthday dinner.  The hotel is new and very beautifully designed, and we had read good reviews of the Burnham.  Did not disappoint!  I recommend the small plates--so much choice!  I had the peiroghi, the fried chicken confit, and the table shared the cheese creme with mushroom.  H had the oyster spaghetti.  Excellent service--not pushy, not absent.  Crowd is good--dates/couples, friends/family meet up.  I don't think this is a kid place--definitely an adult vibe.  I'd like to stay down here and make it a whole night away in my own city."
W1Bx4udLb6n1nXyXR1EwkQ,"Food is ok but expensive.  SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.  The hotel tries to do a good job and wants to provide a great experience,  unfortunately,  the restaurant staff have poor attitudes don't really understand what good service means."
KvlVTV0apy4iA2uYeGGXyQ,"Fantastic restaurant in the Hilton Cleveland! We ordered salads and they were as good as the entrées. Huge offset bowls with enough fresh, unique ingredients (fresh, whole anchovies, pickled eggs, fresh shaved cheese) to make you think twice about ordering additional items from the menu...nah, there's more to explore! You have to try the French toast...yes, anytime of day! It's not what you think. Shredded chicken, a sauce and season combo that takes your taste buds on a roller coaster, and soft & slight crunch in the toast peeking from beneath. One of my all-time favorites!!"
I5Z_P4SftkiI3YEpauiI8g,"Overall impressions: swanky lounge in a swanky hotel serving up new takes on old favorites. Staff are still growing into their roles, but friendly. Good for dressy dates, business meetings, and hopefully drinks on the patio when the weather is warmer! 

It's a shame that this shiny new part of Cleveland doesn't get the traffic it deserves after the boom that was Summer 2016. Getting here is about a 10 min walk from the RTA station, but at night, when there's hardly anyone around, and your phone light is shining brighter than the streetlights... The empty buildings can be pretty eerie. Buuut, I guess I can't complain about having my pick of the reservation times during Downtown Restaurant Week. 

The Burnham can be entered directly from the side of the Hilton building, and my friend and I were pretty impressed by the upscale nautical wall deco. Everything still looked as though the plastic wrap had just been taken off. We were shown in short order to our table, a half-booth ordeal. Normally I'm all about the booth tables, but our booties sank a little too deep into the plush seat and made the table an awkward height to lean your arms on. Which, if you have just above can't-take-you-ANYWHERE etiquette like me, you tend to do quite often. Anyways. We were brought some complimentary bread and olive oil while looking through our menus, but the server nearly dropped the bread on the table instead of our plates, and the bread was quite plainly not fresh. A rough start. 

Our hearts and stomachs dropped a little when we saw our first appetizer (not part of the Prix Fixe menu), five tiny Garlic & Onion Beignets. This was definitely not Southern hospitality. They were pretty good, but gone too soon, including the pickle garnish. Each of us then chose different salads for the first course and were pleasantly surprised by the unique ingredients. No plain Caesar from the grab bag - mine had a crunchy mix of greens, pickles, sunchoke, and a light dressing. Main course involved a Swordfish Schnitzel for me, and a Sous Vide Fried Chicken for her. You heard right. Schnitzel and sous vide, chicken and swordfish? Did they draw these combos out of a hat? Maybe, but they work surprisingly well together - both meats were tender, the accompanying sides (radish + mashed potatoes for me) appropriately balancing. I could probably have done with less salt overall, but know that you'll be leaving full after an entree. The desserts were cute trays of Petit Fours, including cake pops and macarons. Nothing mind-boggling, but easy to pack up and eat on the go. 

Like others have said, service was fairly slow. It took a while for our dishes to come and for water to be refilled even though we were one of probably five tables that evening. The staff is definitely rough around the edges compared to the establishment (I mean, have you SEEN the bathrooms? Go, just go outside across the hallway, and enjoy the gilded glory.). It's not a place you should expect to grab a quick bite - although I think I spotted a kid eating chicken tenders a few tables over. But food-wise, we felt we got what we paid $30 (+ an appetizer) for. The menu, the staff, the booty-sucking seats, it all feels a little experimental, but I think we got some positive results out of the evening."
9Gql5KxYL7CNFQ-8p7A28A,"What a refreshing experience! Beginning with a friendly greeting and seating, followed by a delicious breakfast buffet satisfying every imaginable taste desire, and all made better by the most polite and attentive server we have experienced in a long time. Craig was a pure delight! His contribution to our dining experience was as important as the food. Craig needs to be cloned."
II-azWny-UcJ4qRbfLi99w,"Nice upscale take on Cajun. Nice place for a rich dinner after a day of conference smarts. Our favorites were actually the appetizers: pierogies and the divine goat cheese creme brulee! Hanger steak was delicious and perfectly cooked, if a little salty."
2vzhoc7sLbHgg8Sgw9JLAg,"Ate here when I arrived in the evening on a business trip. It was a strange restaurant. There was a large buffet that appeared to just be supplies (not for customers). 

The waitress couldn't answer any of our questions. My colleague and I both have fairly typical food restrictions (I don't eat meat; he's Celiac/gluten-intolerant) but the waitress didn't know what would be suitable for either of us. The menu did not indicate some key ingredients, either (like that they use bacon fat on the green bean sides). 

She asked the chef and he suggested a salad for my colleague and a pizza for me. The pizza a 6-inch flatbread. It was ok, but felt like an appetizer. 

Overall, it was fine for the lazy evening after a long day of travel, but I wouldn't go again if there were other choices."
XLe5jIvTJ1sNWK1eUFGL0w,We stayed at the hotel and decided to check out this restaurant. All of us were very impressed with the food and staff. The hanger steak I had was amazing. Their version of the carrot cake was nothing like I have ever had but it was great. If I ever go back to cleveland I will make sure I return.
DafT7bpKy17ZDVAMEaxuYQ,"The Cleveland Plain Dealer gave this restaurant an excellent rating, so I made reservations.  After that I read other reviews, some of which were negative, so I dined a there tonight fearful that I had made a mistake.  I was delighted by the delicious food and excellent service!  I highly recommend it and hope that others will try it, as it was pretty empty on a Saturday night, although this could have been caused by upcoming Fathers' Day.
Visit the bar on the 32nd floor for a wonderful view of the city.
I will return and recommend it to my friends."
tSfH2QO3VaqzSSoptwGURA,"Attention to detail on favorite comfort foods such as the Shrimp and Grits and Fried Chicken with charred cabbage results in lively fresh takes on tradition. However the staff was not up to par, the hostesses could not pull up our reservation, waitress got our dessert order wrong, forgot what my entree was immediately after I ordered and there was that discussion on what Prosecco is. That being said, this is a newly opened restaurant and there is clearly a lot of field training going on. Just wish the staff was better prepared. Rating would be higher except for the service.
We'll be back in a few months after the kinks are worked out as the food is so worth it."
WHGIOp9WXdmdQfK0J75ZGA,"I could go on for hours about how wonderful this place and its staff are. I had the best pancakes I've ever eaten and a wonderful mimosa. We came in at noon (lunch time), and the staff happily accommodated our dying need for some breakfast food. This is a must for brunch."
jEJ51P_kl0tAQeHv6vJ0xw,"I stopped in here a few weeks ago when my friend and I were trying to go to the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event and we were starving. It was pretty empty while we were in here, so we got a seat right away. Our server was great - very attentive and our food was super timely. I ordered the Southwest Shrimp Pizza, which was delicious. I wish I could have taken it home with me, but I was heading out for a night on the town, so I had nowhere to stash it. This place is great for an anniversary dinner, lunch with a friend or colleague, or a place to celebrate a family occasion."
xmuXY_woGKKXCDE51fqOJw,Excellent service & food.  I had the grilled salmon & my husband had the muffuletta sandwich.  Yum!
e6nYTVFvKUpu5DHM9iFkOw,"Terrible. Had reservations. Not busy. Hostess was clueless. Left us at restaurant bar and kept seating people with no reservations. Talked to hostess, did not care. Never seated us. Wont be back."
xrM4pyq8aZp2FSI0w2QlzQ,I came here last night while on a business trip. I was not too impressed. The food was decent but the service not so much. We sat on the outdoor terrace and the waitress forgot about us. For appetizers we ordered the calamari which was light and delicious. We also had the shrimp and gnocchi (only came with 3 pieces of shrimp) and the wings which were good but nothing special. I ordered the fried chicken confit which was good but not as flavorful as I had expected. It's conveniently located in the hotel but next time I'll venture out into the city.
J5YmEo_KAGxKF0qHPkDAAg,"Chose to visit the new Hilton Downtown and new restaurant for a birthday.  Chose this restaurant because our party had been to most restaurants in Cleveland and the Burnham had only been open 16 days when we ate there.  

Ours was a party of four and had no time constraints so we decided to do a couple courses of splitting the small plates.  After our incredible waiter Joseph walked us through some of his favorite things and some of the background for some of the food, we chose our first course as Octopus salad, soft shell crab special, chilaquiles, shrimp and grits, and fried rice.  All of these dishes were as advertised and devoured by our party.  The octopus salad was some of the most tender, tasty octopus we have had anywhere in the country let alone Cleveland.  The chilaquiles were like a mexican pancake with pulled pork and rock shrimp baked in.  The shrimp and grits were great.

Our second course we chose soul bowl (mac and cheese with pork belly and collard greens), boudin and mash (blood sausage and mashed potatoes), confit wings, and the five cheese pizza.  While I don't like collard greens, the mac and cheese and huge pieces of pork belly was good.  The blood sausage and mashed potatoes were a british/irish delicacy and delight.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were great.  The confit wings were a bit salty but they literally fell off the bone and were served with a green sauce that I can't quite figure out what it was.  The pizza was great topped with tomato and basil and quite flavorful.

Our party had a couple bottles of wine from the extensive wine list and some of their cocktails (Sacre Bleu and French 75).  The cocktails were all made from scratch and delicious.

The staff at this restaurant were incredible with multiple people from servers, hosts, back kitchen staff, and managers all making their way to our table to wish one a Happy Birthday and welcome us to the restaurant.  The new hotel is beautiful inside.  Wish the Bar 32 (bar and patio on the 32nd floor) was open but its still not finished.

Our server Joseph made the night especially nice with his knowledge and hospitality.

Would like to try breakfast/brunch next time maybe but we will definitely by back."
h3zHv4zMD6Zk2lNcUOw_-A,"If you want to eat at a restaurant that strives to exactly satisfy the average palate of the average American diner, this is the place for you. The menu and the wine list will have exactly all the regular, normal choices that the average eater will not be offended by. If you want a memorable meal, go elsewhere."
JmnlfM2kHumv4doQVMVCtA,"I'm not sure why urban farmer has better review than this place. The food was really good for a restaurant that is maintained by the hotel. I've tried 4 different meal and dessert and nothing is bad.. I'm thinking that the review is low due to price but I can assure you that the quality and freshness of the  ingredients is fantastic.. u get what u paid for. The service is not bad... just a relax environment in which u can enjoy your dinner.. I'm giving this a 4.5 star due to price but if u are looking for a quality and taste, this is definitely a must try in Cleveland..

I recommend any seafood entree.. salmon, trout and walleye.."
BPjU8lYAIF_lIXyb1fytfQ,"I came here for a late solo dinner, got in on a business flight around 10 PM.  I had two small plates, the shitake perogies and the goat cheese creme brulee because they sounded the most intriguing to me.  B  The goat cheese was rich if not particularly flavorful, went very nicely with the crostini that came along with it.  The perogies were a definite hit however, savory with tart sauerkraut and a nice mashed potato side.

The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  A nice selection of beers on draft.  Overall a very acceptable hotel restaurant, can't comment on the entree options but overall this is a place worth a visit if you want something simple and are staying at the Hilton."
cETj4CWuBK9BOcevvqyj3A,"Slow service and okay food.
Only ate here because too cold to walk anywhere. Waiter spent most of the time chatting with another table while I needed service.  Will not eat here again."
tDAYPNunvDQICwZDLnEMdw,"Came here for lunch with two others and did not have a great experience. It was pretty busy upon arrival, however we made a reservation so we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. It was a nice day so we were asked if we'd like outdoor seating, which we agreed to. 

Service was extremely poor. We had a reservation for 12:15, we were sat at 12:20 and we did not get our food until 1:20. It took 20 minutes for our server to ask us what we wanted to drink, and another 5-10 minutes for my soda to arrive. We weren't told what the soup of the day was, we weren't told about any specials and we weren't even asked if we'd dined with them before (this place just opened after all). All in all, our server took 30 minutes just to take our order.

25-30 minutes later our food arrived. My friends got the field green salads (which they actually enjoyed, hence the two stars). I ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich, which I did not enjoy at all. The breading on the chicken was bland and tasteless and to be honest, when I cut my chicken open with my knife (this is an open-faced sandwich by the way, something the menu doesn't say) it looked pretty gross in the middle. My fries were simple shoestring fries that tasted fine.

The poor service in combination with the bland tasting food will be the reason I likely will not return. With all the great restaurants available in Cleveland, this one is not worth going to (at least for lunch)."
AVBow8SUmRV8kWSm42TKVg,"This was not the best experience. The food was decent and the service was terrible. Waited entirely too long for basic things like drinks and to place our order.. mind you, the place was no where near full. Our waitress could have cared less about anything, and it showed. 

Won't be going back ever. Not worth it."
e5xyJVOcHfnK_TfxoD-0YQ,"Really enjoyed our night sitting at the bar at The Burnham. Rob the bartender/mixologist (not to sound too hipster but this guy is a professional) was very knowledgeable, funny and a great steward for Cleveland. He gave us tips on where to spend our weekend and he did not disappoint!

On to the food: Husbandface was obsessed with the pierogies, I was obsessed with the French toast small plate. I'm going to try to recreate it at home and will probably fail a million times it was so good.

Drinks: Thumbs up. Let Rob know what your tastes are and trust him to make you your personality in a glass. Because that pretty much happened.

It was our first time in Cleveland and we had to force ourselves to NOT go back to the Burnham for every meal just so we could branch out!"
w_SJN1pAGI05_3--iQRPsw,Had the fried chicken confit. I swear on earth I've never had anything better. It was the perfect size and the cheese dumplings on the side were perfect.
wcNkOZrQ7EJkBVENNKYeEA,"Food is pretty good for a Hotel. Much better places in downtown, especially for dinner. Service was terrible.  Hilton needs to up service in the restaurant.
My wife and I were meeting people in the terrific bar on the 32nd floor. I showed up late an had trouble getting someone so i could order a drink.

Decide to have dinner in the Burnham.  It was 8:30 on a week night. Almost no one in the place. Our server may have also been the bartender.  She paid almost no attention to us. 
Bad service can certainly ruin a good meal."
pMQLU95oQJhth_LlF2mE3Q,Food was good. Had to wait a very long time for eggs and sausage. Team seemed to be short-staffed in the kitchen. The wait impacted my overall experience. I expected more efficiency from a 4-star hotel.
E66PNQ0qcgkP_XKYtLl67w,I love this place! Sherri the bartender was awesome and Chef Ryan brought the food directly to me! What a friendly environment I had the buffalo pizza and Caesar salad my first night and the muffalatta sandwich the next day. Everything was fresh and tasty!!
5ZRvCtvBdANoufZF02fSig,"Hotel restaurants are always hit or miss but this one was a nice experience. The ambiance is upbeat and lively -- an open kitchen will also help with that -- and the prices were fair, if not better than expected. My Cotes du Rhone Rosé was $9.50 a glass and the dinner specials on a Saturday night included a super affordable (and pleasantly portioned) Sous Vide Chicken plate. Nothing crazy but just a nice simple home cooked meal while traveling -- something we all crave. 

The Sous Vide chicken was well prepared, maybe just a touch over done, and the creamy mash and broccolini were nice accompaniments. While the broccolini was a tad under-salted, the mashed potatoes were a bit over-salted so I ate them together and it was perfect. I can handle that. I wasn't however, a fan of the BBQ sauce that adorned the chicken. Thankfully, it was mostly served on the side so the dish was still a great choice. 

Johnny was a very pleasant server and we worked up a nice rapport by the end. His recommendations were genuine and he steered me toward a dish that I would enjoy - one thing I appreciate in a server! His push for the featured Mitchell's Banana Pudding ice cream was a win, especially with his flexibility in swapping out the vanilla ice cream on the chocolate angel food cake dessert dish. Yum!

All in all, I think the restaurant offers good value, a fun vibe, and it's awesome that you can go for pre- or post-dinner drinks at the 32 Bar (rooftop)!

Final thing: I loved their dining chairs. Upholstered and so comfortable. It may sound silly but chairs make a huge difference! I felt relaxed the whole time."
TlqanzBRxIDcTVD1R7cSJw,"We came in after watching a sunset up at Bar 32 on a Friday evening. I had read all the Burnham reviews and looked at the menu on line. It looked very promising. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away. 

We had a reservation which was not required. 40-60% full during the peak dining hour. Service while attentive was only hotel restaurant style, Lacking the type of service professionals found in fine dining establishments. The menu was very well composed and interesting. It offered some good choices. But the preparation and presentation was just ok. The prices were not outrageous. 

No way it gets 5 stars. So not a destination place in my book. If I have to meet someone staying in the hotel, I am happy to have a meal there. But no more Burnham date nights for me."
_xE_ahMSmcELTNHq61CyrA,"I'm always a little skeptical of hotel restaurants/bars, but this one impressed me. Everything was delicious and service was great. The atmosphere is pretty decent, but the patio wasn't open yet when I was there, so I suspect that it's great. The tapas are really unique, but my husband and I opted for entrees. I did see the table next to us, ordered tapas, and they looked and smelled amazing, and we're really generous portions. My husband thought his pork entree was smaller than he wanted, but my fish was perfection. I can't wait to go back for girls' night to order a bunch of small plates!"
MNhhAQe9H_wiWRulvkSgxw,"I wanted to give this place one star before ever stepping foot into the restaurant... 

I called on a Monday to make a reservation for 12 people. I was told by the gentleman who answered the phone that he needed manager approval for that many people, and put me on hold. I waited a few minutes, and when he returned he informed me that he couldn't find a manager but would take down my information and someone would call me back. I waited 24 hours and didn't hear from anyone, so I called back. I explained that I had called the day before and needed to speak to a manager, and was placed on hold for ELEVEN MINUTES before I finally hung up. I called back for a third time and immediately asked to speak to a manager, by which the person responded rudely ""well can I take a message, we are a little busy right now."" I said ""no, you may not take a message, I need to speak with a manager immediately."" I was placed on hold AGAIN, this time for more than five minutes. I FINALLY got a manager, Franc, on the phone who didn't even bother apologizing for my troubles. 

On Wednesday I get a call from the restaurant (two days after my first attempt to make a reservation) telling me they couldn't accommodate my party. I explained to them that the manager had confirmed just yesterday, and after being placed on hold YET AGAIN, they confirmed that indeed they could accommodate me. I mean honestly. FIGURE YOUR SHIT OUT. 

If it were up to me, I would not have even given this restaurant my business after that experience, but the group had already collectively agreed to eat here.

Fast forward to Saturday... Our server was nice enough but his ""helpers"" were more attentive than he was, we waited forever for our drinks and dinner, one persons meal never made it out, and the food was just okay.

Overall, the experience was awful and there are so many other restaurants in Cleveland with better food and service. I will not be returning to the Burnham."
RwsIfYNZL_BCI-38VLxOwA,"The fact that this place has 3 dollar signs is not accurate to me. I had a chicken confit small plate, which was more than filling, and it was about $11. I was really craving fried chicken and that meal hit the spot with hints of exotic undertones! Really nice, modern, and quiet ambiance for a late dinner and the staff is readily available to suggest what to eat. My co-worker and I enjoyed the experience. 

Only thing I would say is that the menu needs an interpreter basically. When you first look at it you read something like bread pudding but then underneath it states there are gizzards in it. Not typically what you would think, right? Fact of the matter is, after our waitress explained the take on bread pudding and french toast that they utilized, it was much easier to make a decision. My co-worker got a french toast type plate which was a savory take on a pulled pork dish and she thoroughly enjoyed it."
uQNlt_KWDXMnLG3DNZNW9g,"I was at The Burnham for the first time this past weekend.  It was my friends birthday and we had a party of 6.  The service was great!  Our server was super nice, kept our drinks full and brought out our food in a timely manner.  I got the salmon and it was delicious!  The skin was super crispy and it was a large portion.  Everyone at the table was pleased with their dishes as well.  The staff was very welcoming.  I would highly suggest going here."
y-gnP-jAxUK7srlxuAX9sA,"I went here for dinner a few weeks ago. My friend and I were planning to do apps and drinks at the rooftop bar, but it was closed for a private event so we decided to head downstairs for dinner. A lot of things on the menu sounded really good to me, but I went with my usual go to and ordered the salmon. It was pretty good, but was just super salty so not the best I've ever had. My friend ordered the Southwest shrimp pizza, which was amazing! We were one of only 3 or 4 tables in the restaurant so service was great. The prices were about average with most restaurants downtown so nothing too shocking."
6H_D6GT4Q7NMMdhOdUkEAg,"The Burnham just opened on June 1st and we thought we'd try something new. Normally, new restaurants mess up something so our expectations were not high. Let me say this...Burnham was phenomenal and exceeded all of our expectations by leaps and bounds. I cannot wait to go back!

The decor is very modern, yet warm and inviting. The service was top notch and very friendly. We were seated next to the bar so had the chance to interact with their bartender who made the experience even better. Super friendly guy, very knowledgeable mixologist--everything he made was great. After the first round, we were letting him just give us whatever he wanted. He makes great mocktails too.

Food..OMG. I want to go back the very next day and repeat the entire experience. We ordered several small plates to start with: calamari, pierogis, and octopus. Everything was delicious and the preparations were creative and unlike what we've had at other restaurants. We especially loved the sauce on the pierogis and the octopus was so good we wound up getting another order. For dinner, we tried Oxtail, Burnham Burger, and Shrimp & Grits. Once again, everything was top notch...our plates were clean very quickly. Even the dishes we were on the fence about ordering we wound up raving about. 

The Burnham is a great addition to Cleveland downtown - we'll be back!!"
Wx7rFTMZmYktoQ3d3orseA,"The brunch buffet had a beautiful display and was dutifully maintained. The eggs were a strange, jiggly texture and bland. The French toast was great, but the syrup was flavorless. Excellent tasting and perfectly portioned smoothie shots. Not all of the items were clearly labeled so my vegan friend was upset from consuming meat in the potato hash. I recommend signs for each prepared item with symbols for meat, dairy, soy, seafood, and vegan items. 

Thank you for handling our large group with great service and attention."
yopVrikncv_54eR44R9sHQ,Great variety and the best dog in town. Try the rice crispy marshmallow shake/flurry thing. Ridiculous!
fQn5gA-jXYHefi2Kxx9rcg,"This was my first visit and I was definitely NOT impressed. The service was quick, but not necessarily competent and the food was overpriced. *On a side note, if you order root beer with your combo, be prepared to receive a 12oz drink instead of the 16oz that supposedly comes with it."
HzreYQD3_VOa-MvleCQhEw,"Went to their grand opening on the June 17th and despite the fact that they were slammed I cannot say enough about the customer service and hustle the entire Retro Dog team exhibited.  The wait was long due to the insane amount of guests but have every expectation that their service will be no less than amazing going forward.  The atmosphere is bright and upbeat with an updated diner feel.  The original artwork speaks for itself.

I tried the Retro Dog as I am a HUGE fan of Coney dogs.  The sauce was different and sweeter than the ""traditional"" Coney sauce but a good surprising spin on an old original.  Toppings were ample and the natural casing hot dog cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Coney fries to go with and I may have overdosed on the Coney aspect of things and think they might ne better paired with a different dog.  Delicious all the same.

The custard cone with the salted chocolate dip and caramel was ridiculous.  Although full from my meal, I still couldn't help but finish.  The salted chocolate adds the perfect savory to the caramel's and custard's sweet.  Retro Dog is definitely worth a visit and I plan on returning multiple times to try the entire menu."
E73McNvR0dT-l-7mlsh_7A,Good food. Way over priced as everything is extra. Tried copying Teds Hotdogs in Western New York. I'll wait for a road trip back home to get my dogs at a much more reasonable price.
6D0JvHSBurLYbC_o_drcJA,"This is my regular lunch stop when I am in Stow. The food is fantastic. There isn't an item on the menu I haven't had and haven't enjoyed. 

Come for the food, but stay for the shakes.  If that isn't your thing go for the root beer on tap. It's the best in town. 

The monthly food specials keep the menu interesting. 

The absolute best aspect of Retro Dog is the staff. I haven't met a better crew anywhere else. 

In short, this place receives two lion fists up from Voltron."
3Gvujhjh6KuKSI8_tQvKFw,"If you are looking for a fun little place to go every once in a while, go here. They have all sorts of good quality hot dogs and hamburgers; including veggie style ones. The drinks and milkshakes are awesome, too. The ambiance is very cheesy, but it works. I want to write more about this place, but there really isn't a lot to say. It's a hot dog place...

You'll enjoy!"
DHidMDAlWr0o68QjpQLWCg,"Love this place! My kids ask to go every week! I don't eat red meat, so of course when my husband suggested a hot dog place I reluctantly went! I was pleasantly surprised by the menu! A veggie dog, chicken sandwich and veggie burger! I've had the veggie dog and chicken sandwich, both were great! I'm trying the veggie burger next! Oooh, and the milkshakes, so yummy. Oh and the veggie cheese fries, so good! Even if you like meat the veggie options will satisfy...just has my husband the meat eater! 
Not only is the food great, the service is absolutely amazing too! So friendly!"
2MnVp-o1vsKm0e4OtjKzBg,"Fun place and something a little different.  Hot dog and burger options abound.  The onion rings and fries are greasy and delicious - dip them both in whatever magical sauce comes with the onion rings.  Chili and root beer are also good   This is not a place for people who are afraid of calories - they have a token side salad and a black bean burger if you want to feign healthy eating while scarfing fries. Ordering is kind of a pain especially if there's a line since there's not a lot of room to stand in line - you order at the counter; then the order taker takes your money and gets your drinks; you sit down; and they bring the food out to you sometimes having to call out by name.  They have car service outside, why not have wait service inside?"
SU2WI-MJ7xnXZjPEqvuNRw,"I don't know how they stay in business.  There's never anyone there.  
The dogs and milkshakes are good.  It can't hold a candle to Swenson's, but it's closer to where I love, so it's still a contender for me."
xdq5wPhRrjLnoW2_6ye5PQ,"Not what I was expecting. The ""retro"" style was only apparent by the colors of the restaurant. 1990s music was playing. 
The food was nothing to write home about. The same veggie hotdog can be bought from the local grocer. The vegetarian coney sauce was nothing fantastic.
Fries are not fresh cut. Not especially delicious.
On a positive note, my mud pie shake was delicious.
Friendly staff.
2 dogs+2 fries+2 shakes dine in= $20.81 
Overall, it was mediocre. Not worth the bill."
rCjA0LCkBnvyz-56SMVxUw,"Retro Root Beer in a FROSTY MUG!
Super creamy, real Frozen Custard! 

Burgers, Dogs and Fries with an overwhelming array of topping choices. 
We visited on a Sunday evening, and ate inside. 
Everything was fresh and delicious. Service was spot-on!

The Onion Rings were a highlight for me... Made fresh to order, tender inside, light and crisp fried tempura batter outside. I'm my opinion... They could NOT be better!
Highly recommend that you give RETRO DOG a try!"
KJjIQhaE5Ws6ujjRvUq9DA,1st trip here .. my husband had 2 dogs w/yellow mustard .. I had 1 w/chili + yellow mustard + 1 with chili + yellow mustard .. we both enjoyed our dogs .. but the stand out was the battered onion rings .. totally delicious .. wish we had gotten a large order to split but w/2 dogs each we wanted to pace ourselves .. root beer float & black cherry soda were the chosen beverages .. we will be back .. not only for more onion rings but perhaps to try a burger next time .. a bit of a drive from our home in Cleveland but a decent road trip to treat ourselves every so often .. far exceeded our expectations & now there is no need to go to Sonic ever again .. thank God!
zRhusCsWxEentZn1sI_o4Q,"This review is written by my 6 year old son. ""The ice cream is really good and icy here. The twist is my favorite. Also, the grilled cheese is pretty cheesy!"""
ExBaH0kM9OqRKCrAresYEg,"I appreciate what they're trying to do here. They went all-in on the retro drive-in look and unique variations on the dog-and-burger menu. 

I've tried three different dogs and one burger; fries and rings. The meat and fixings are fine -- not spectacular, but OK. On my most recent visit, the poppy seed bun for the Chicago dog was distinctly stale. (I've run into a similar problem at some other places, where they don't sell many Chicago dogs so the special poppy seed buns sit around for far too long.)

I'll echo what at least one other commenter said: The sodas are bizarrely small portions. They boast about their own root beer. In house, it comes in what looks like a nice-sized chilled glass mug, but turns out to be largely ice. I got a to-go version one, and it was a tiny cup, again with the ice -- and filled to the brim so that spilling was inevitable."
X2sysdEU1OCSmb94fYQvGQ,"i'm generously giving RETRO Dog 3 stars because it's a cool concept and a cool looking place. there was really nothing wrong with our food, it just wasn't awesome and there was a HUGE issue with the place we didn't notice until we sat down (we ate inside).

it was Danielle's idea for lunch (because she thinks i have the palette of a 4 year old, i guess) and we drove out after making our final payment for our September vacation (which was on the way). 

Danielle ordered a Memphis Belle Chicken sandwich and i ordered a Carolina dog and a White Hot dog. we got these as combos so that we could share an order of fries and an order of onion rings and each came with a soda. 

Danielle said her sandwich was good but was served very hot (which i'd like to think is the idea, right?). the White Hot that i ordered (a hot dog made of veal and pork - which looks ""white"" when cooked) was good enough, but not terribly flavorful. it could have used a spicier mustard or maybe just more than what was on it (which honestly looked like enough). i didn't care for the Carolina dog (a Coney w/ coleslaw and yellow mustard). i didn't like the coney sauce or the coleslaw. in fact, i removed the wiener and ate it separately - making it considerably more tolerable. the fries and the onion rings were good, though maybe the rings were a little overcooked. i thought they tested good anyway. the sodas were really small and the entire cup was filled with ice so that you took about 3 pulls off the straw and the Coke or Diet Coke within was gone. they were kind enough to refill, though. 

our biggest complaint was that the place was overrun by flies. they were everywhere. i'm not some dandy that can't handle a fly here and there, but there were like 8 per table just hanging out flying around and on the food and just buzzing our faces while we tried to eat. 

assuming we go back (and i would like to try the Kraut Dog as well as the Big Sal sandwich and maybe others) we'll probably order from our car or we'll get it to go and dine without the flies."
joEoPyM5UFau13jXIfP-nw,"My friends and I walked to Retro dog after school. We assumed it would be cheaper than wing warehouse. The staff was helpful and friendly. My friends and I got milkshakes and burgers.
I got a milkshake and cheese fry and my friend, who I payed for, got a burger and milkshake. I didn't expect the total to come as $20 but we enjoyed our time there and the food was good."
pSlId5PfiBAJZpHAEFu-qg,I really was looking forward to a great hot dog and was suprised the retro dog was so tasteless and boring.  I was surprised when I saw the lady sweeping the floor put  the broom down and take the French frie with her bare hands and put my order of fries in the fryer.
-gbBG4UXcK_cAqO1O8NQJg,"Went for lunch with co-workers. I had the Chicago dog and onion rings with a drink. Dog was excellent, rings not so much. Incredibly greasy - even too much for rings. Unfortunately my co-worker had a disasterous Retro Burger. There was a 9"" or so brown, curly hair found in the MIDDLE of her burger. 

We observed a female employee with shoulder-length, brown, curly hair; not tied back or in a hair net, cooking the food. This is gross, unsanitary, and bad restaurant management.

According to www.fda.gov - retail food protection - Chapter 2-402.11: "" (A) Food employees shall wear hair restraints such as hats, hair coverings or nets, beard restraints, and clothing that covers body hair, that are designed and worn to effectively keep their hair from contacting exposed FOOD; clean equipment, utensils, and linens; and unwrapped single-service and single-use articles. 

It was asked that the burger be re-made, and yet again, the same female employee was cooking as before. The practice of employee hygiene is a basic essential of running a restaurant. Shame on the owner for not being aware of day-to-day operations with his/her employee(s). 

I will not be going back, nor recommending this establishment."
TyrcA5E6m4Bgeg1_I5GH2A,"New drive in - classic style! Hosted my son's 8th birthday here and the staff and food is amazing. They brew their own pop, root beer and beer as well. Lots of special events and great burgers and dogs."
OwhOCgrFw8kI2mFKPNm3ww,"Others seem to enjoy the restaurant, so maybe you will enjoy it, but...

My wife's hotdog was warm rather than hot. It was also very small compared to the bun. My cheeseburger was the same way.

The root beer was close, but too sweet for both out tastes.

I think that they spent too much effort on the decor and TVs and not enough on the food."
skTMN0wbSn-munCNyOBKEA,"Run, don't walk, to Retro Dog. Had lunch there yesterday. Great food and very nice and attentive people. Had dogs and delicious fries, very crispy and hot! Dogs had a nice snap and the buns were perfect. They have so much more than the dogs, too. Lots of choices. Don't let the exterior fool you, it's not just drive up. There is nice seating inside for at least 40. Get out to Retro Dog and support a local business with very good food and wonderful people!"
pIs1EOdGrunBWO00KLOpZA,"Love this place, cool decor, great menu and friendly staff.  We go out of our way just to eat here.  Most likely one of the rare instances where a hot dog place also offers great burgers, shakes and even a veggie option!"
XJ3061Gi1XkQl69oKLhdkw,Nothing fancy at all.  I was expecting something like Chicago dogs.  Pretty small also considering it's a hot dog place
B_fkii_XiE-DYaGaM_mfqA,"This is the part of being a food adventurer that bites you in the ass.  This has got to be the 2nd worse place I have ever been too.  There dogs are no better than what you buy at the store, so save yourself time and money and just go to the grocery store.  For 4.29 I got a foot long dog that was saturated in crap!  I couldn't find the dog at first and had to get a spoon and scrape everything off.  There were more topping than dog.  If you don't like toasted buns, don't go here.  I HATE toasted hot dog buns WITH A PASSION and they do it here, without asking if that's what you want.  What I make at home was also more tastier.

I also asked for a strawberry shake, because, really.... how can you mess up a strawberry shake.  Well, they did.  It wasn't that cold.  It was lumpy with what you might call frozen strawberries but it wasn't cold or thick at all.  Almost as if they let ice cream thaw, then scooped it into a glass and let it sit for awhile.  EWWWWWWW!

Save yourself trouble and got to McDonalds if you're really in a hurry and can't go to the grocery store.

The staff is ok, but not on my list of nicest people in the world.  I got the feeling there were more concerned with sales than pleasing people.  Small parking and one car runner ran into me on the way in.  
DON'T GO HERE!"
ermuBFPmiXeA7ld1j9VlRg,"Drove by after a long run and we were curious... No expectations...and were super happy after! We were pretty hungry, order a Carolina dog and Chicago dog (yum yum).  The all beef dogs are excellent and they have a good choice of hot dogs types.  The Buckeye shake was delightful, but we love PB and chocolate so you can't go wrong.  The fries were basic.  Would stop back if ever in the area again!"
aihG-xrXpflyAdgcJx5maQ,"1st try we sat in parking lot with lights on for 15 minutes.  No service, no one even looked our way.  The only people waited on were the ones under the canopy.  No signs anywhere that they only have service under awning.  Swenson's services their whole lot!

2nd visit I got a spot under the canopy.  Waitress came to car and wanted me to order.  No menu boards, no menu, I ordered 2 dogs and Onion Rings.  Ordered 1 all beef and 1 natural with the same topping and an order of onion rings to go.  Both dogs barely warm and 1 had the correct toppings, the other one had I don't know what on it, some sort of hot relish maybe?  Onions rings were the greasiest I've ever had!  Great concept that failed to deliver!!"
Z-IvmnW-mBo0tLt5WdaCLA,"Best Chicago Dogs around. Vienna hot dogs would be better, but these are the best we've had in the area! Kind of pricey, but cheaper than driving to Chicago! ;)"
V7RP6vuDEakRfbKev0Tk3A,"I love a good hotdog. I was out with my son and we came across this place. It looks like a new place trying to look old. So, the name is perfect. The layout reminded me a lot like sonic and the drive ins back when I was really young. The interior is really nice and I thought they did a great job of decorating.

I ordered the Banzai dog and my son ordered the White hot dog. We also decided to get a large order of fries to split and my son got a root beer. We went there about a week ago and my son is still talking about how magnificent the root beer was. He also loved the hot dog, but said it might have been a little salty. I thought that the banzai dog was also fantastic. The banzai sauce is really what makes it. You could put that on just about anything and make it taste good. Plus, its covered with bacon.. 

Whenever I order fries and I see that they are fresh cut fries, my brain automatically thinks Malt Vinegar. I grabbed one of the containers and took it back to our seat. We were seated along the windows so when the light hit the container, something caught my eye. It looked like there were 2-3 ants floating in the bottom of the container. I took the container back to the counter and gave it to the person there and showed them, told them I thought they were ants. Then I noticed all of the vinegar containers had this substance in them. I went back to my seat and a few minutes later the manager shows up with a pan, in which she had poured out the vinegar in to show me they were not ants. She explained that it was a fatty spongy substance that collects in vinegar containers. I told her that I have several different vinegar containers at home, some that I have had for 2+ years and I have never seen this substance. I She said it is common and found it on the internet. So of course I asked the obvious question, ""How long has that vinegar been in those containers that it would have this fatty spongy substance?"" She told me that they empty them every week and refill them. Now, I know I look like I just fell off the yam wagon, but I find it hard to believe that your vinegar forms that in a week and mine hasn't in over 2 years. My ten-year-old was able to ascertain that you were full of crap so needless to say, your excuse needs work. I wasn't asking for a free meal, just say ""Geeze, that's gross.. let me get you a new one."" 

Regardless of the vinegar incident and the manager clearly trying to cover her ass, I thought the place was great. I will probably return again if I am in the area, but I think I will skip the fries and vinegar."
tHDgCqXk5X7g2zxSwX9H6A,Talk about living the old car hop idea.  Retro Dog has amazing food and awesome service.  Their milk shakes are amazing.  The flavor combinations are always spot on.  You can go in or have the car hop come out and bring you your food.  Love it.
WN0XEZ6pI8_jJAHea7jkBg,"Delicious natural casing dogs with a variety of toppings, great milkshakes, awesome design. Very happy to have this new addition to the scene.

EDIT: After many return visits I can say the quality is consistent and the staff is always very friendly and competent. It has become my favorite ""fast food"" stop. Oh, and try the Retro Burger, it is, dare I say, better than a Swenson's Galley Boy. I know, blasphemy, but true."
fCmGRcztKpZjOx-utDF6TA,"Nice variety of dogs and burgers. Place has tasty vegetarian alternatives. Come alone, with friends, family or just you and the kids."
YyueVBhLcEbkTqwS-Mgd6g,"I was the only car at curbside, yet it took 5 minutes for someone to bring me a menu.  I paid $22 plus for a cheeseburger, veggie dog, two orders of fries (which were very small) and 2 shakes.  The cheeseburger was not edible.  It was fatty and there was so much salt on it that I had to throw it out.  While good, the fries were in a really small cup.  I could pay the same price and get a large overflowing cup at Five Guys.  The only good thing from the whole experience was the free trade coffee shake.  Won't be back for the food."
5GqgskX_c1xjciY7UVbXSw,"Great local joint with an old fashion car hop service or eat in there dining area bar stools and tables.

They have great dogs, burgers made to perfection with all kinds of toppings.  The dogs are great love the Chicago dog best in the area.  The shakes and ice cream can't go wrong and try the old fashion root beer float."
5PlM8Xo0v0Kmu4jNn64UyQ,This place was gross! The best thing on the hot dog was the mustard I had Conney sauce and Cole slaw and they were no good. And on top of it the Server that came to the car was rude. They didn't say hello...how are you...nothing! They just handed a menu thru the window and said turn on your lights when you're ready to order. Then when we were done they never said how was everything...nothing! Even tho they seen my brothers hot dog only had one bite missing from it because it was so nasty! For a $4 dog and service like that this place doesn't even deserve a 1/4 of a star!!
DSqAdScruiejUwPCQSDmyg,"Really great food! A nice variety of hot dogs, toppings, and sauces. They also have burgers and fries.  We ordered a footlong dog, a natural casing dog with bacon, and the home on the range fries. Amazing! The fries were a bit spicer than expected, so we ""had"" to order ice cream. Darn. :)

Overall, a really great little place. I'll be back soon."
jO6eZE2mi_WxVIP26DRInQ,"If you want to relive your misspent youth, or get a flavor of where to go after the sock hop ends, this is the place. Tasty, tasty hot dogs, hamburgers, and the usual sides, plus milkshakes and other desserts. Pull up and order from your car, or sit outside or inside. I often get a hankerin' for a coney dog in the summer, and I really enjoyed the Retro Dog. Hot dog was perfect and a nice soft bun to keep the coney sauce to hot dog ratio just right. The Carolina dog had a flavorful complement of coleslaw for a mellow blend of dog and vegs. Got cheesy bacon fries, which have some heat due to the spicy fries coating. Onion rings were also good. They are also open late when there are events going on at Blossom."
PhBKEEu83SAetEomaT7Jxw,"Heard this place was terrible from a family friend & wish I would've taken his opinion to heart. My fiance & I were scouting Retro Dog out for possibly having their food truck for our wedding reception but they instantly failed. 

I am a french fries queen! I can tell you who has the best fresh cut, frozen, sweet potato, etc fries around and Retro Dog is not one of them. They claim to be fresh cut but they tasted a little frozen. My fries were not raw but were definitely not cooked long enough (no crisp, just limp d*ck). Sadly, bathing them in a small cup of salt & malt vinegar didn't save the day. 

Then my fiance ordered their Chicago & White dog but said they weren't very good & he could've made better at home. He also ordered their tempura onion rings- F**king disgusting!!!! The onions inside were cut way too thick & therefore weren't cooked all the way.  The batter tasted like idk what- a really bad knock off of Arby's curly fries &, again, was undercooked & greasy. Even if I had just gotten off of a crappy 12 hour shift at work with no break and an hour long drive home I wouldn't eat their food. Less than 15 minutes later I got heart burn so...


As for their service- not bad, but their Root beer float was the only good thing that I had. But i must admit, I love the concept & the decor- just not the food!"
CjkPcxbRsWEIY09-t9aFOQ,Soooooo disappointed.  As others had mentioned the onion rings are horrible...just rings of grease. The actual hot dog and burger were tasty...but bread and stuff not so much. I've had better root beer...odd after taste. We gave you a try...there is potential.
ksvW7VPBlSnNNL9YVc4CSg,Good hot dogs. Good root beer. Not a chain. Good times.
vdQw1CMDiiDkt9kM6YqoEw,"I was very impressed with RETRO Dog. As an ovo-lacto vegetarian (I eat eggs and dairy products), I am never sure if somewhere that specializes in hot dogs will have any options for me, but RETRO Dog has not one but three vegetarian entrees--a veggie dog, a veggie Italian sausage, and a black bean burger. They also offer veggie chili, veggie coney sauce, and veggie cheese fries.

I had a veggie dog with veggie coney sauce and cole slaw and a side of onion rings. The dog had a pleasant texture and flavor and the toppings were scrumptious. I have tried quite a few veggie dogs in my day and this was definitely one of the best. The onion rings were unlike any other rings I have tried. The batter had an interesting flavor and was not crumbly like many other rings, but it was crisp and delicious. I also enjoyed the zesty sauce that accompanied the rings.

I chose the locally-brewed root beer for my beverage and I was not disappointed. The flavor was mellow and not overly sweet and it was served in a fancy chilled mug. 

My dining companions ordered a veggie Italian sausage, a RETRO Dog, a Red Hot, and a couple other meat dogs and everyone was satisfied. We also happened to go on a buy one, get one free hot dog day, which was a pleasant surprise for the pocket book. 

We chose to eat inside, rather than utilizing the Swenson's-style carports. They looked fine, if that's your thing. The atmosphere inside is a fun mix of retro kitsch and contemporary. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly. 

I highly recommend RETRO Dog. I will definitely be returning to sample the rest of the vegetarian delights and specialty sodas."
b6dami4YHihHprxXxHnLUQ,"Here to tell you I think this place is off the hook!  I was excited to try it & was not disappointed.  At first I thought they were a little pricey, but put things in perspective.  The ingrediants are of higher quality than you would think.

Went on a Sunday afternoon & it wasn't crowded at all.  Four of us sat at the counter and talked to the friendly staff members the whole time.  I ordered the Chicago dog & really loved it!  Boyfriend got the Carolina dog & he loved it!  The boys got the Coney dogs and wanted more.  Nom, Nom, Nom...

Few things worth noting... I am a designer and I was digging everythig about this place!  The layout, the lighting, the surface materials, the graphic design, etc.  I can really appreciate all of the nice, clean details this place offers.  I even took a pic of the rest room!  A+ to the design team!

They even have nice, thick, soft napkins which were like a luxury!  I want to work here just so I can get a red pair of Converse! Seriously,  I love their uniforms, very cool.  If they sold their shirts I would buy one!  Love the artwork & colors.  Again, well done & kudos to the artist!"
MN1aB9zV3Gzf0brixIOOpQ,(6-18-12) My daughter had a Noon appointment not far away - pulled in at 11:05am figuring a hot dog joint should be able to get us in and out within 30 minutes. Boy was i wrong I had to FLAG DOWN a server @ 11:40 just to take back the menu since i knew we wouldn't have time to order and eat. I sat there with my lights on from 11:20 until 11:40 waiting for someone to take my order. Several servers looked like they were afraid to talk to people as they run back and forth looking at the ground. At one point i counted 6 cars under the canopy with lights on and no one around. One employee stood in the front of the building (apparently on break) just looking at all the cars with lights on. MANAGER NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I will try again as they are new and hopefully everyone will be better trained.
Fjzz9mrJOJYcgzSKK4hwFw,"Overall fantastic place. The decor is very cool and the food is good. Even if you are not a fan of hot dogs, they do have burgers (including a black bean burger!) and chicken options. I had the original retro dog- diced onions, chili, and cheese. It was quite yummy. There was a hint of cinnamon in the chili that I could have done without but it was still delicious! My combo also came with a side of home-style fries which were surprisingly crunchy as well as tasty. 

Retro dog also offers a variety of retro sodas- cream soda, black cherry, root beer and so on. The root beer is actually their own recipe and made locally. It was a sweeter take on root beer than most places, so if you like sweet pop, you will definitely be a fan :) plus it comes in a frosted mug, just like all root beer should!

Customer service was fine, seems they have worked out any kinks they may have had since opening earlier this summer. I know I will be going back!"
V9m8P5v5j1oR3a_7yV4oyw,"I recently dined here and was very disappointed. I have dined at many different hot dog establishments and this one was overpriced in my opinion. The fries were over seasoned, making them very salty and inedible. I enjoyed the snap of the hot dog, but didn't find it to be a hot dog I would throughly enjoy eating again. I also had a float, it was ok but I feel it was overpriced. 2 fries, 1 hot dog, 1 foot long and 2 floats equated to almost $30. Sorry to say, I won't be coming back."
x9VRH2EiErU6nRR17Lhmsw,Loved it since it opened. Everything's great but be sure to ask for your dog ungrilled if you don't like the charring. I like it like that but my kids don't.
ISqcpzX8fEXxZIBrltu8pg,"This place is good.  The hot dogs are excellent and the burgers are good.  They seem like decent people and are friendly.

My biggest complaint  is that it is a bit on the expensive side.  We go here fairly regularly."
U7HAqwM-zm5lj03y3FXt1w,"I have to rate my visit as a 3 this evening (unfortunately). And really that's pushing it. The hotdogs were excellent; however, the fries were over salted and oily, the onion rings were dripping in grease. Very little onion and way too much batter. Please, please change your oil! The root beer floats - well let's break that down; root beer was great but the custard ice-cream seemed to have ice chips in it. Not creamy, but ""ice milky"". Lastly Retro Dog should have ""Retro"" music. Stick with the dogs and you may enjoy your visit."
Nl7Txb3LDY4MadHSHOYb7Q,"I didn't get a hot dog, but I did get the ice cream sandwich.  I would give just the ice cream sandwich five stars!  The butter pecan and caramel cookie ice cream sandwich was recommended to me by the cashier.  She did not lead me astray.  Two huge cookies with ice cream (which was at least 1.5 inches thick).  I would go back just for that delightful treat.  
I also got the chocolate malt, which was very good, but not great.  
Everything else looked decent in the pictures, but I did not partake."
2u5l4skrEctKOZfhqvJHYw,"Retro Dog is a cool place to stop if you are out in the Cuyahoga Valley or at Blossom and feel like a snack or some ice cream.  Kind of separate from anything else, you will see a large take out with parking out front where you can have the food brought out to your car or go in to the cool dining area.  The decor is bright and in your face in a good way, kind of a very modern expression of a 50's diner.  The menu consists of hot dogs, sandwiches, sides and plenty of ice cream based desserts.  

I have had the veggie retro dog, the fries, onion rings and a couple of milk shakes, overall the food is good, not great.  The veggie retro dog is a pretty nice veggie hot dog with veggie coney sauce, mustard and onions on a wheat bun.  The mild hot dog has a nice snap but it could have used more of the toppings, especially the coney sauce, which is a mild veggie chili.  The french fries are fresh cut, but were not terribly crisp.  The onion rings missed the mark with the fried batter overpowering the flavor of the onions and they seemed a bit overcooked.

The 2 milkshakes I tried were the best items I had at Retrodog; prepared fresh with soft serve ice cream.  The flavor selection is extensive and they have some unique flavors for you to try.  The chocolate banana was a nice balance of the banana milk shake with hot fudge; the salted caramel was a nice balance of sweet with a hint of salt.  Overall good shakes, especially using soft serve ice cream as the base.

Retro Dog is probably not worth a special trip or the place for a full meal, but if you are in the area and need a snack it is worth a try."
iq7sszeuGeX_XlEu8ESXbA,"The Red Hot was very soggy. My bun fell apart. The Chicago Dog has good flavor, but the wiener was nothing to write home about. Overpriced and flies all over."
Z9HivQIQpAijL2ZccSI6Rg,"Great service, OK food.  It seemed like everything was just a little off.  I had the Retro Dog and onion rings and the hubs got the Carolina Dog with fries.  The hot dog itself was really good... Mellow taste, nice snap... but the coney sauce was a turn off.  Very sweet, not much spice.  My husband said his Carolina dog was good, but he said he would try something else next time.  The onion rings really had me excited because they looked perfect... they weren't.  The spices in the tempura overwhelmed any onion flavor that might have been there and they were SO GREASY!  I ate one and a half rings and had to stop.  The fries were just OK too and needed to have salt added to them.  They had a really nice natural potato flavor but they tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while, which seems implausible considering how busy they were.  We also ordered the root beer and the flavor was not unpleasant, but it was very flat.  Considering how very sweet it is, it could have used more carbonation.  

I would like to return to Retro Dog and try a dog with just mustard.  Of course, we also need to try the custard!"
_Hc2ABjlPWUxOGtvhKFTTA,"I really wanted this place to be amazing. The food is just okay. Nothing too spectacular. I didn't find a WOW factor. I do feel like it is REALLY expensive. For my boyfriend, daughter and I, we can drop $25 easily and thats not getting a lot of food. At all. I do find the service to be hit or miss too."
UDJEIoZ1sNCFNz1BTrp5FQ,This was our second time here.  The first time we came the service was slow and they kept forgetting parts of our order.  It wasn't even busy.  The coney sauce wasn't very good on our first visit so this time ordered our stuff without it which was much better.  The service this time was better but we also ate inside too.  Their custard and fries were great both visits!
WDNZOLZ8xqD34XUeRBqwSw,"Nice little ""drive-in"" diner. It's literally in the middle of nowhere but worth the trip. We went on the behest of my brother in law, and couldn't have been more satisfied. Actually ordered a couple hot dogs and the wife got a burger. The meat was seasoned well (pause) and the dogs were grilled perfectly. Ordered the loaded fries (tip: you can go for the regular size portion if sharing with another person, it's plenty!) and was stuffed the rest of the day and we ate there at 5PM. Staff was super friendly and helpful with our order.

Will definitely be back. To get more food, because why not?!"
TzLCnpe2XT_iJzkPE2th3Q,"BING BANG BOOM BABY! This place is baller. From the Chicken Sandwich to the Hot Dog to the kick Ass Shakes. I love this place! Gets me feeling craZy!!!! Killer stop after cruising the valley on your mid 90s hog.

Seedable-"
IV_XpEcTssyXZz6QQHDlfw,Cool LOOKING place but about $25 for 2 chili dogs 2 fries and some sodas was WAYYYYY TOOO MUCH MONEY and while it was a cool looking place....I would NOT go back only because of the sky high prices.
2AgUAZmfayZAqVOhrJ15Cg,"Owner could not even take the time to address concerns with management and bullying of employees. Terrible treatment, service, and management. Will NEVER get my business again."
nnnr3NU06dUbHPHYhH6K7g,Went there on a Monday. Placed looked like a slow night.  The selections were interesting and the fries Tasty.  Got two of there special dogs(Chicago and Bonzai). Buns were very stale and i think the dog was on the griddle a little too long. If I'm in the neighborhood I might give them a try gain but nothing I would go out of my way for. On a positive note the Employees working were very attentive and nice.
Oq3fB2xci6V6jugCa0Pt4w,"What can I say about the food. It's awesome. Great family atmosphere. The onion rings are amazing and even the chicken sandwich is good. But skip that, grab a dog."
TTMT3YcZ1me82C-Azw7PBQ,"It's an unusually warm day, almost 60 degrees, and I thought you need to go eat at a drive-in and take in the balmy day. I've been to Retro Dog once, not long after it opened, and I wasn't impressed but I thought give it another shot. This was going to be a 3-star review until after I finished eating, turned on my lights, waited 15 minutes, then had to CALL them to come out and take my money. The young man really was giving good curb service until the end. He was very apologetic, but come on, he saw my lights on as did another young man. They took care of 3 other cars and ignored me. Anyway, as to the food, it was just ok and pricey for the quality, $10.55 for a bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and small Coke. Nothing I couldn't have made at home better. No next time for Retro Dog."
5uiEKMwuH4BNPKPncNCRvg,"Even though I planned my weekend in the Akron area around burger joints, beer and baseball, I couldn't pass up a hot dog place so close to my hotel.  You know, just for a snack.

For some reason, I was feeling adventurous that day.  I went against my instincts and, at the recommendation of Liana E, I went with the veggie dog.  I got mine topped simply with just the special mayo mustard.  I also went, of course, with a cup of the locally brewed root beer.  I debated the growler when I saw them on the counter, but it seemed a bit pricey (I think it was $15 for the growler full of root beer).

I took my cup and dog to go, but really just sat outside at one of the tables since it was such a nice day.  I unwrapped my dog and was surprised at it's size - bigger than I expected.  This was going to be more than a snack.  I took a bite.  And instantly my brain thought, ""This doesn't taste like a hot dog.""  Then I remembered, duh, I ordered the veggie dog.  The taste was not unpleasant to my meat-loving sensibilities.  And the special mayo mustard, which I think was just mayo mixed with dijon mustard, had a nice flavor to it.  Though I'm not sure it was the best condiment for the veggie dog.  The root beer was aces.  I still regret not splurging on that growler.

I've vowed to return to the area and I'd like Retro Dog to be part of it.  If I enjoyed the veggie dog so much, I can only imagine how much I'd like the meat hot dogs.  I also saw some amazing looking onion rings I'd like to give a try as well as some tasty looking desserts.  Seems like my kind of place."
6IjSwXOZYw08x7XVqASkYA,"I am a vegetarian. The veggie dog was not that good. It tasted a bit...old or dry maybe. The veggie chili was also a bit dry and very salty. There were lentils in it, but there just wasn't enough moisture to make it that enjoyable or enough cheese to save it."
cJvPR9c9f9aOYAqc3W5LGQ,"Great concept.  Food is good-fun menu and terrific custard desserts.  Drive-in service as well as indoor/outdoor seating.  Firepit for cooler nights.
Plan on visiting many more times.   Onion rings are fantastic, hot dogs are good, chicken sandwiches are great!"
626Ty7htUS6jl4HdsbFQMw,Eaten here a handful of times. The hot dogs are good. They have nice snap when you bite into them. Burger decent. Nice to go to when your going to or coming back from Blossom. Root beer is good too. Worth a try. Use the coupons you get. I think the prices could be a bit better. But I'm cheap so I don't like to pay a lot for a hot dog. It's just a hot dog... But worth the try to see if you like it. Eat inside. Too messy to eat in your car. But it's cool to eat in your car so if you don't care then go for it.
Jt0eh-6av_BQbatsrFngbw,"I've been to Retro Dog several times including before, on and after the grand opening on June 17th. I'm not sure what people expect from a brand new concept restaurant in this area that's not even a franchise. I, myself, being a reasonable and realistic person who also manages people for a living, was prepared for the imperfections in service. The great part is there's already significant progress being made. 

The food is really good. I've had the retro dog, the white hot, and kraut dog (so far, my fav), and am starting to have some fun building my own. The bean burger is very interesting and tasty! The veggie dog is also really good. I love that they have healthier, vegetarian options. But the ultimate is the Retro Dip. This is a cone of amazing deliciousness. Who knew I'd look forward to the very bottom of the cone as much as the top?"
YteUSdhWSsMjuFPxAiWwVw,"Randomly found this place after a concert at Blossom and overall I enjoyed it.

Service is quick and food is out quickly as well. I like the fact that they bake their own buns, definitely creates a different experience.

Personally, I'm a chili cheese dog man and was sad to see none on the menu. Never had tried a coney dog prior, instinctively I ordered one as well as a Chicago dog. As far as taste goes, it was definitely tasty, just not in the sense that I'm use to. The Chicago dog was excellent and PACKED with overflowing toppings and tasted great!

My SO got a coney dog as well and pretty much shared the same experience. She's a chili cheese dog person too. I know.. we're meant to be together haha.

Fries were fresh and their onion rings were unique and intimidating but definitely delicious! Loved every bite.

And last but not least, their MILKSHAKES. Thick and flavorful, just like a traditional milkshake should be. Chocolatey goodness!!!!

I'd definitely come back again!"
DlGANFJ2Lfu6K-mdpRN2MQ,"Traveling through town, we were looking for an inexpensive, quick, unique place for lunch. This is certainly it.  Wonderful hot dogs and great frozen custard. The atmosphere is great but the highlight had to be the onion rings. Wonderful batter, crispy and delicious. Would certainly recommend this place. Our family of 4 ate lunch for about $34 without custard."
sXLp0ZarK3D9Xh1Nh6Q5Pg,"I just loved this place! Neat atmosphere and the entire staff was friendly and helpful! I got the Hula Burger and BLT Fries - loved the hula sauce and burger! The fries were very good too - but next time I'd get the fries with hula sauce on them. 

They have very cool ice cream options too! One of cups has a sundae at the bottom and a milk shake poured over it!

I can't wait to take my family here! These kind of burger/hot dog joints are my new favorite places to find!"
Bok7L4o0gJtIb5u_O-EU4Q,"Huge disappointment. Great concept, great atmosphere. However, food was less than. Hot dog and fries were overcooked to the point of being burnt. The onion rings were the only good part of our meal. It was sad as our expectations were high."
76-P_Of30jjOzioj7_H-2g,"I have never had a negative experience here! Quick service, food is ready quickly, servers are sweet. Cream soda is addicting! The hot dogs and burgers are delish! We have been coming here since they opened. Only thing we have never done is go inside to eat. It's always so fun eating in the car with the kids!! You should eat here!!"
g5mWOnIXc317bZ6W7Mci1A,When I drove by I had high hopes.  Not so much after stopping in.   The dogs were just ok.  I got the White Hot and a regular with Coney sauce.  The wife got a Kraut dog.  We each had an order of fries.  Mine were the garlic Parmesan hers were the rosemary.   We couldn't tell the difference between the two.  There was not enough salt/flavoring on either of them to tell the difference.  The Coney sauce tasted burnt.  The Kraut dog was just okay.  The white hot was just fine. And last of all the prices were very high.  We wont be back which is a shame.  The decor is great. The service was fine.    The place could be great it just needs some work and better quality control and 15 to 20% lower pricing.
t0kYA8OAJmlIy8QYIIndhg,"very good tasting hot dogs, a lot of options for toppings. a little bit more expensive than you'd want just for hot dogs, but the atmosphere is awesome and there's a lot of menu choices. I would recommend."
_rJzi4ycLF3t0VscjJkqlA,"I normally like retro spots like these. This one didn't really wow me. The food is extremely greasy, kind of flavorless and they cover all the ice cream in chocolate syrup. The service was pretty speedy and I've never seen it jam packed so you can get in and out quickly. Decent place for a quick bite or if you live in the neighborhood and want to walk up it would be a nice little walk."
wrB1_kYGWqSBKII_rMO45g,"The beef hot dog tasted like a regular pork hot dog. No""snap"". Very disappointing. The fries were good. I won't be back."
nK4xEEC7B868dGKxRdzFUw,Chicago dog was delicious.  My husband had a double cheeseburger was probably the best cheeseburger Ive had in while.
e40w_6A0Nqw73GBsOBO0Vg,"My significant other and I have been frequenting this establishment since it opened. We could probably walk there in less than ten minutes. He loves the natural casing hot dogs and I love the Retro burger. Both are an incredible quality at a great price. They also have some of the best seasoned fries around. I throughly enjoy all of their frozen treats as well. They make a frozen custard marble that is amazing, with any topic you can think of, plus their milkshake selection is seriously impressive. I dig the curb side dining experience, and Retrodog is doing it much better than any of the other competitors around. The staff is always sweet, quick and you can tell that they enjoy working there. Great customer service. Oh yeah, and they make homemade root beer that is very good and unique. It's a must try. I'll never go back to a Swensons/Skyway/A&W ever again. The quality of food alone makes them stand out above the competition. IMO they are the number one burger/hotdog/fries experience in the Akron area."
33-dltZ7zXzFO7p-XxfqZA,"This place is great! The white hot (veal/pork) dog is amazing! The shakes are amazing and their hula ghost burger BLEW MY MIND! made with a ghost chili sauce with bacon, grilled onion and pineapple makes for a burger that's out of this world!"
ZCKHHymksJ9iMOte-yxF8Q,Seriously. Banzai burger. Best I have ever ever had.  Everything at this old school/new school place...reasonable prices and tasty service...
SWQdtCMugPomTdq_iAqEUg,"I tried this place today and it was really good! I ordered the retro veggie dog and cheese fries. The retro dog was really good it came with chili, mustard and onions. Being an all vegetarian meal I was pretty pleased. The cheese fries were fantastic! Crispy and the cheese was yum! We will be back."
5yYeifSxcVQPJESPlE6Drg,"This was a nice change of pace from our typical road trip meal stops, but it was nothing that blew my socks off. The dog was fairly tasteless (I'd rather have my store-bought Hebrew National any day) and while the toppings were decent, it was nothing that made me say WOW, I WANT ANOTHER. I tried the home brew root beer and again, it was decent, but I like Barqs better. The best part of the meal was the fries. So, an A-OK stop and if I lived close I'd definitely try other menu options...but as a one-off stop, it didn't thrill me as much as I'd hoped."
Hfhr1C53RyT9PoDVJonE8Q,"Save your money. Onion rings were dripping in grease! Hamburger had no flavor. My third time here it's good in theory, just not in execution."
gANC6mBUOLKHqqRjaYMgQQ,"Was down in the area for some hiking and remembered seeing some good things about this place. Retro Dog is really in the middle of nowhere which explains why it wasn't so busy but easy enough to get to once you know what streets to take. The car hoppers came out very quick, gave us the extensive menu, and came back out just as quickly when we were ready to order. The shakes were DELICIOUS and the hot dogs were very good too. Good choice of bun as well. The fries with cheese sauce and bacon were also very good.

Overall, my wife and I definitely enjoyed it. We put it right up next to Swenson's as one of our favorite places to go for food. Very good!"
ZB02COirMJvKCOehmzEePQ,"Did a Hula burger, it was different but pretty good. Onion rings are awesome! Coleslaw was not all that good."
2pEd1p3bv5NhZIV7FeUw-g,"Man do I love Retro Dog!! This awesome mom and pop business does not disappoint.    

It's a hot dog place, so of course the dogs are wonderful (my favorite is the Carolina) but that doesn't mean you should shy away from the burgers! Whenever I'm really hungry I get a Hula burger. Provolone cheese, lettuce, grilled onions, bacon, and a pineapple slice all doused in this incredible spicy hula sauce. Yum!

Don't forget to save room for custard! Not ice cream, but delicious, creamy custard. There is not a single thing on the desert menu that I wouldn't get. 

The service is very friendly and helpful! They genuinely seem to be very happy at this establishment. Not the usual disgruntled employees. The managers are just as wonderful! Always making sure you're happy, and that your visit is a good one.

This place is unlike any other restaurant I've been to, and I always recommend it to anyone who is ever going through that area. I love retro dog!"
fDPEUWEylLnHQjGTb88o1g,"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews! I went for the grand opening and while we waited for our food it was so worth the wait. I'm a hot dog snob, expect to pay more for it and was not disappointed. The natural casing dog was perfectly crisped in the outside, flavorful on the inside. I ordered the Kraut Dog, kraut, pickles, mustard, delicious! We shared the chili fries that really hit the spot and finished it off with their house root beer. I'll definitely be going back to try the rest if the menu soon... Especially the chili dog."
0ATspk6mvqL5M6DoIjFuyg,"We were here on a weekday afternoon.  I had a white hot dog and my companions had Chicago dogs.  Mine was acceptable.  Their hot dogs were not great.  If you strip away the bun and the toppings, the hot dogs should be amazing.  They were very flat.  There is a huge difference between cheap hot dogs and flavorful hot dogs and these were generic at best.  The hand cut fries were decent but not amazing.  The onion rings were awful, full of grease, and well done.  The dip for the onion rings would be better if it was a full flavor mustard.  The service was quick.  The prices and portions were acceptable until we ate the food.  We were seriously disappointed."
5nXykjVXwjIYHHhnyus_AA,"This place was great. I don't understand the poor reviews. One of the best hot dogs I've ever had. Milkshake was solid as well.

And the poor waitress braved a monsoon to take our order quickly. 

Can't wait to go back."
Fn6CK4sjJt4PL9sYGcLuKw,"Excellent local restaurant for grilled American fare. The selection of burgers, hot dogs, shakes and fried foods is just incredible. There are also vegetation options (dogs and burgers) which is greatly appreciated! The place is clean and neat, and the service is quick and modernized (they use iPhones to ring you out). One minor issue - the hot dogs and burgers are great, but the buns themselves are either too big or too soggy.  The food is incredible, but a better bun makes a even better sandwich."
UXnMFX2z5-SX3uZoYqzlIg,"I can't believe some of the complaints on here! Retro dog is awesome plain and simple, if you don't like something you picked out build your own meal! They offer that. Any who, never have had a bad meal, in fact we drive from North Royalton/Strongsville just to have there food! There hot dogs &&& burgers are to die for, seriously! The prices I don't mind at all either because I work at a family establishment and times are tough and so are soaring prices in the food industry! We love you retro dog!"
5QLj2PYisso1Mjf8ePUAsg,"Harold and Kumar traveled how far for these dumb burgers...

Totally not worth the hype. My ex stoner roommate was obsessed with White Castle and used to buy the frozen ones.. So when I tried these for the 1st time I couldn't believe how it tastes exactly the same (yuk)

People were buying them by the case when we walked in, total disappointment. People in the east coast got it all wrong these soggy sliders are crappy. Another reason the west coast rules."
1x5xGqyKg9vtfrIXKVd6uw,"Need to be a teenager, drunk, or stoned. It took 15 minutes for a single to go original slider. Greasy, heavy on sautéed onion, very thin patty with very little texture... I'll take a McDonald's hamburger any day. Looked better in the movies."
MZ8DnofZvbnespruAOT4Pg,This is seriously overrated!! They are really just burgers mini sized. My fiance scarfed down 4 mini burgers. Their fries were gross. It was not salted. I ordered their chicken rings and it was really just chicken nuggets in a different shape. AND it's expensive!
aOc2urRuLBAol6y10lwvbw,"Set your expectations really low when coming here and you might not hate yourself too much for spending your well earned dollars here.  

There was nothing memorable about having them.  We came here for the novelty of trying it out just once for the sake of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle.

I'll give it an extra star because I think these things would make great drunken munchie meals, but then again, so would everything else."
1CGsM6-g0gP2tP430jDriA,"Yes, there is now a White Castle located on the strip in Las Vegas. Everyone who wants to try them without going to the Midwest/East coast can now have a taste of the well known slider. I have enjoyed White Castle before in Chicago and found that they are quite tasty and I can put a few back. My cousin always orders them with extra pickles.  I should have remembered that when eating them in Vegas.  I forgot that tidbit, but they were still really good. I really wish they had a location in Denver.  That would make my year.  The best 2 things about the one on the strip, they are open 24 hours and they sell beer.  What can make this place better? Well, it is also attached to a casino! The place was hoping and cranking out burgers at a rapid rate.  If you haven't tried White Castle, now is your time."
-4lz4jSlOeGyIbmFqbdPxQ,Got to get em hot fresh off the grill! No you can't take these Lil babies home. They get cold quick. They don't sit on your belly all day. It's a reason people in Saint Louis call them sliders. Lol Yes my husband is from Saint Louis so I have a degree in the fine art of White Castle. You order these when their is a long line. You sit and eat them. I enjoy them most when I have been dancing all night and the club is closed and it's 3am. And all my friends meet up to have these. Omg the fries are great with cheese. And the breakfast sandwich is devine. I give them five stars!
yn6Pxvx-R5X3LUrdxVSq2g,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Midwest sliders. Freshly made and tasty. Brought back memories from Chicago late night slider runs.  They have onion ""chip"" rather than full onion rings. Think onion rings cut into pieces. 
And being Las Vegas, this White Castle serves beer - keep that buzz going! 
Friendly staff and a dining room cleaning crew that was constantly keeping the place clean."
9VlUxstf22VBfFPIcZM6eg,"Very small restaurant capitalizing off the brand's nostalgia and charm. They sell their signature miniature ""slider"" sized burgers at an overpriced rate. This seems to be the selling gimmick for White Castle, luring in drunk gamblers or curious tourists to stop in. 

The restaurant itself is attached to the casino of the Venetian I believe. It is located on the Strip, with a one door entry point. A long line of hungry customers fills the restaurant, although it moves rather quickly. There are only 5-6 tables, with 2 larger bar-stool type tables for seating. As you reach closer to the register, you are welcomed with a better view to the behind-the-scenes look of White Castle. Rapid hands swiftly assemble buns amongst grilled onions and juicy meat patties, exchanging between different work stations to finally end up placed in a singular order, ready for the customer. 

A large glass window display showcases some of the White Castle souvenirs that are available to purchase to take home. A $10 coffee cup or a $25 T-shirt? Not for me but maybe for others. 

Last, but certainly not least, was the food. If you're familiar with the case and recognition of White Castle, then eating at the actual location only provides a slightly more fresh experience than the frozen, store-bought burgers. The buns are much softer and are squishy to the touch. The taste and aroma of the grilled onions complement the meat patty. It's White Castle, there isn't much too glorify about it or expect. 

My experience was pleasant, but to each their own. For $8.99 you can get 4 Cheese Sliders, a small fry and a small drink. The price is consistent with the glamorization of the branding. I ate each slider in about 2 bites and was still hungry afterwards, but didn't want to face waiting in a long line again. 

If you are nearby in the area, take a look!"
rNhtH_D8FOF79b7u5e4png,More of a nostalgia thing for me growing up in Minneapolis and eating them as a kid.  Price seemed always right and always fresh and delicious.  That thing they do with the onions is over the top.  Not as good a burger as I remember as a kid but maybe I have eaten too many celebrity chef burgers and acquired a different taste.  Hard to park to get there but if you're in the neighborhood pick up a few and enjoy.  Fast and friendly service and smells great.
7j_gZ0Q_itkSL2gLS1SrQg,"Ok so I'm not from the east coast so I've tried many burgers in Vegas and I was pretty disappointed with these. 

Food: 
Cheese sliders- 2/5 I ordered the cheese sliders. The burgers were small and pricey. I didn't like the smell of them and I didn't like how it tasted like a burger from any other franchised restaurant. Nothing stood out for me. 

Chicken rings- 1/5 Seriously don't get these. They are crispy but flavorless and super thin. Honestly thought McDonalds chicken nuggets were better. 

French fries- 2/5 Fries were a bit soggy. But these were my favorite out of all the stuff I ordered. 

Service is GOOD! 4/5:
Expect a long wait. I waited in line for more than an hour but I got my food in less than 5 mins! They are friendly and efficient!! They try to make the wait bearable by talking to you, which I thought was neat. 

Overall if your a person who likes a burger with flavor and who has ate many flavorful burgers, White Castle isn't for you. I was quite disappointed but many other people love the simplicity of their food. This joint just wasn't for me."
tk0HH_JjPKbTGDldkzFDtQ,"The wait is long, but definitely worth it! I wish there was one in So. Cal so I can have it more often than twice a year. The service is definitely quick and accommodating."
zd7Y4SNEVxs3DiNME-R-ow,"I really don't get the whole hype about this place. I mean it's a bit different in the way they serve their burgers but I felt I couldn't really enjoy it entirely because they serve them in bite-size pattys. 

I was hoping it would of felt like a meal but honestly it felt like a mid-day snack before lunch. Fries are good but I don't think I will be coming back to try it again. Unless someone can convince me that there is a must try item on their menu. I'll stick to regular in n out. Service here was horrible. The one thing that did bug me was when our order was called. My friend was already heading to pick it up and the lady begins to speak on the Mic. ""Number ???, you will find your number if you have  looked in your receipt on the bottom part of it.""  And I mean she said it with an attitude as if we didn't know it was there. So unnecessary and uncalled for."
vbmLnOY92VKHKqGXkLeHHg,"Got the #1 - 4 Regular burger pack w fries and drink $7.99. 
I wish I got the cheeseburger it has more flavor the regular was a bit dry. But nevertheless it was fluffy buns, grilled onions and tasty. I realized there is no real sauce in these burgers but grilled onions gave it flavor. I've tried the frozen ones it's similar but these were more fluffy buns and softer meat patty the frozen ones were drier."
zLA_57ge8X1oUXY2rEUHzQ,"This place is literally the worst place I have ever been. (Service-wise). The food is relatively standard-ware. I came and waited in line with 3 of my friends on an afternoon, and waited about 20 minutes in line to place my order. I understand that places get busy, so it was acceptable.

However, after about 30 minutes of waiting for our orders, my friends all got their orders, but I still had not yet received mine. I inquired several times about my order, and where it was in the queue. My friends finished eating, and we kept waiting around.

Each time I asked, the person handing out the food would promptly dismiss me, and even the manager bluntly and rudely told me they serve hundreds of burgers a day, and it would come out soon enough. 

Also note - my order number was 374, but they kept on calling order 274 out. I asked if they perhaps had my order ready, but they told me no, they had Order 274 ready, and that it was not my order.

Now, about 1.5 hours after entering the restaurant, and an hour after placing my order, I demanded that they finally look inside the bag, and the manager who had been extremely rude finally conceded that they had mislabeled my order.

Instead of offering anything to help make it better, they only offered me a brownie, which means that they valued wasting about an extra hour of my time at ~2 dollars.

If they had merely checked the queue the first time I asked, no problems would have occurred, and we could have resolved all the issues. Instead, this Whitecastle decides to run as if the customer is always wrong, and will stonewall and lie to you about your order.

Once a mistake is also made, they will make a measly effort to fix their problems.

I strongly recommend you go elsewhere for a burger fix in Vegas."
DBrpeGYkGcDn211STRX1WQ,"Im from NY and loved it there, but this was not as I remembered.  I bought a crave case, all the burgers were warm and dry like eating toast.  They all had some kind of freezer burn marks on the edges of the patty.  I remembered it being steamy and delicious, I hope they improve because I love WC!"
9Jl0EiHnHLkYqeMPRQSYGQ,"Listen folks....White Castle is not for everyone.  If you're curious about these little cooked to order sliders just try one or two at the most. I definitely don't recommend a full meal.  Vegas location means Vegas prices. It may not be worth it to you. Now for all the lovers & fans of this tasty little spot..... be prepared for greatness! Its always super busy here which is assurance that everything is fresh, hot, & ready to go. They ppl here a great system to get you in & out. You can even see them cooked the burgers, grill the onions, & steam the buns while placing your order....but i must warn you...be prepared to pay Vegas prices. Hope this helps!"
ZQlYABRnCFo1yyBVvlDjrw,I've always wanted to try this place BC people always says it's good. Well they were right. I love the fish and chicken breast burgers.
Z9TEswpvicHTKFdCiOM4Ug,"white castle is a horrible  place to work! my son n law worked his first shift and was locked in a freezer multiple  times,made fun of because Edward and Francisco didn't  like his name,they refused to teach to teach him his job even though they were suppose  to train him, and he didn't  get a lunch or breaks until the two boys got off shift and an actual manager was working and gave him a lunch break his last he of work! I will most definitely  be contacting an attorney! go back to the east coast white castle we don't  need companies  like yours here if your going to treat people poorly! remember  bullying  is not tolerated!"
L78YGuZQsdiQf5O3OywalQ,First of all this opened 15 hours ago. The wait was not that long considering I ordered a crate w/cheese (100 sliders w/cheese). The manager maintained eye contact with everyone on line (less than 20 people at 530am). I seen over 400 burgers leave in the 15 minutes I was there. The place was clean and I could not smell smoke (it's inside a casino).
htOqpm9U7I1E_F2_89LA-w,"We have eaten the White Castle freezer pack sliders and I was curious to see the most western White Castle location in Las Vegas. None in California. The sliders are almost identical except for 2 things: these ones contain a pickle and the bun is more moist, some were soggy. I got super indigestion after eating 4 of these guys. It was nice to try once in person but that's it."
PKYWQwRAgqqQu7s-amFglA,"Cute little burgers. Good ratio of onions and pickles. Kind of wish it had already come with ketchup or mayo inside. I guess this place is really only for those who know what to expect. If not, kind of setting yourself up for failure."
YXIwgxUdY2ZsvXQx45RVtw,We finally tried White Castle. The line was unbelievably long. The service was friendly and quick in helping. The hamburger was different then any burger I have eaten. Their very simple and tiny. The burger is super thin and small  which includes a pickle and a few chopped onions. The bun is super soft but delicious. The combination of cheap and small makes you want to come back for more. Unfortunately you will need to order quite a few in order to feel full. Sometimes simple is better. There is no glamour to these burgers. The restaurant is full of people with happy smiles. Unfortunately the location needs to be cleaned more often after people eat at the tables.
wR9bPZ7PfsmxKeBM7t-oZA,"I like this place. The workers have great customer service and their services are fast. I seen a couple complaints that this place is similar to the frozen stuff.  Um.. yeah... shouldnt it be??  If i owned a restaurant and decided to sell my food to the grocery stores, i would want it to taste like it was the same as dining in.  
Las Vegas is a tourists city and I'm very grateful for restaurants from around the world to land here.  It's very welcoming for those that moved out here and miss what they grew up with."
PrT4llvkHw6UDw6mboL6Kw,"I agree with most people that White Castle is a bit overrated.  The fries are akin to the ones you got in grade school cafeterias.  The sliders are tasty.

The service was good.  We came by at 11am on a Monday and ordered a 10 slider pack.  There was only one couple in front of us but we got our food within a minute after ordering."
Zkq4gXrQ8xKcnFrEf9giLg,"Oh my...

As a person who has at times struggled with weight I have to say that going to the Las Vegas White Castle location was the biggest boost of self confidence.

The average circumference of the people that were there to eat was over the morbidly obese range...one guy had a gut that was drooping over his shorts.  And I saw a few order the 100 burger box...I actually couldn't help myself but stare several times...I felt instant guilt and wondered how many children in the Philippines were hungry

I liked the burgers but after seeing what can't be unseen...I won't be going back and I'll be heading to church to pray and to the gym to run"
yJwTxilbGkfjcfcwnToYog,"My mom use to buy these babies at the grocery store all the time but I finally got to try this place out!  I loved it!! I am sure people love it when they are drunk as well but I was sober when I ate these!  The ones at the market do not have pickles in them but these do.  The taste so good with the cheese!!  Their fries are pretty good too as well as their fried onion things.  Kinda like onion rings.  I would definitely come back!  Too bad they don't sell it in singles.

NOTE:
-Extra charge for cheese (30 cents each)"
moir5eYkWaMtIVvdc9lWjA,"So, I came here the last week I was living in Vegas hoping that it would be as amazing as Harold and Kumar show in their movie about how amazing White Castle is.  I literally went on a journey from Reno to Las Vegas, then finally got to White Castle with high hopes.
Yea there was a long line (its Vegas, there are long lines everywhere and long wait times in Vegas on the strip).
We got our food quickly, but oh my gawd it was disgusting.  I am so disappointed that the burgers were watery, like they were frozen and not cooked all the way.
The sliders filled me up quickly, but it was not satisfying. Definitely really expensive and not worth the price. 
Dont expect to have that amazing experience there, unless you are super drunk or high and dont care what you put in your mouth. Fries were ok."
lspsuJKW4OEgErfxhzl6Ig,This place is great for a late night drink food run. The line can be long but is worth it. If you do come with a large group order the large pack.
q94LMwM0jRkV7o60ISDftA,"There is nothing special about this place. Read the Yelp Reviews and trust them! Do not come here! Harold and Kumar promoted this place like no other so everyone had to come try them, I was one of those people.

The sliders are worse than the ones sold in the frozen foods section. It is small and will fit into the size of your palm. The bread was slightly warm and soggy. The patty was dry. The small pickle was lying naked alongside small speckles of onions. It was not tasty at all. I had to squeeze a full bag of ketchup on it to give it life. For a dollar something each, I would rather walk myself to a McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu.

My boyfriend and I decided to come here because it was 5am and he was starving. Shake Shack and Rasising Canes were both closed so White Castle it was. The next morning, my boyfriend and I woke up with bad tummyaches. Luckily, our hotel had two bathrooms...."
TwNnTZubPbYjUBWGnBa3vQ,"White Castles are not a common sight in Los Angeles county.  Friends say that they were once plentiful, but I understand that they have retreated to the comfort of the east coast. Save this one. This White Castle is all alone out here in Vegas. So, it was on my list of things to see and experience in Las Vegas. I'd never had one. Not even from the grocery store. I'd even seen all three of the Harold & Kumar movies about them. I was super excited. Well done White Castle!  
    So, I parked my ride back at the LINQ self parking, and hiked down this way to get to the Treasure Island for the Pirate ship battles and the Marvel thingy. It was quite of a hike to thie point. Several times I pondered giving up and taking the Monorail. But I persevered, and this was a well deserved stopping point. The Las Vegas strip is deceptively long.  
     As I entered there was a bit of a line at the counter when I walked in. The sounds of the nearby casino jingled and buzzed and tempted through a huge opening in one wall. I assume the White Castle is open at all hours to collect the hungry gamblers. Which is probably alot, as the smell of burgers wafted across my nose as I looked up at the great big menu to figure out what I wanted. Looking at the items, the prices ranged within your usual 'fast food prices'.
     There was a range of options. Meat, other Meat. Fake Meat. No Meat. All the glutens, none of the glutens. Even Vegetarian and probably Vegan options. I saw a sign for a double cheeseburger combo (little teeny ones) and decided that's what I wanted. I wound my way through the line and got to a register, and ordered one from the nice lady behind the counter.
    I was given a cup and a receipt. I took both to find a place to sit. Easier said than done. This place was pretty popular. Eventually I found one at a high common table. I set my camera bag and phone on the table corner to mark it as being taken. As I went over to get an iced tea, I heard my number called. I altered my trip back to my table, and veered back over towards the counter to pick up my tray of food. I was excited, I was eager. I was going to try White Castle burgers. I reached into my bag and withdrew the three small boxes inside. 
    Hrm. These three tiny things are supposed to fill up me? Seriously? Hrm. Ok. After the yelp photo, I carefully pulled out the miniscule burgers, doing my best to save the buns from ripping. I excitedly took a bite of one. It was okay? I was not as awed and amazed as Harold and Kumar were. I wasn't overwhelmed and taken away on a meaty dream sequence of awesomeness. I was just kinda sorta whelmed.
    Even the iced tea was that fountain done stuff. Not brewed iced tea. Meh. I'd have rather been eating a Carl's Jr. Big Carl. But. I'd finally experienced it. Checked it off my list. That's part of the excitement of life I suppose. To get out there and try new things. Sometimes they're just not as great as the commercials."
iacbQ03b5IQM1WgaAS89oQ,"I turned the corner and there it was--HOLY SQUARE BURGERS, ITS WHITE CASTLE!  Been living in Washington for almost 20 years now and when I saw that blue and white--ITS WHITE CASTLE!  I know when I walk through the pearly gates, right next to the NY Pizza place will be a White Castle!"
GLaeGjCSIO0krPal3-DW-A,"No. It's over rated because of its reputation but the food is not good. A single slider was 2.50 and that's as much as a burger at in-n-out. This is a ""only choice"" type of eat. Don't eat here if you have other options. Not to mention it's the only one in Vegas and for locals the parking and ordering and dealing with all those tourists is too ridiculous."
FtO1FykFid19U03zPxbobg,"I expected better from here. The sliders weren't that tasty and became a chore to eat after a while. The chicken rings tasted like frozen dino nuggets (not even as good as Dino nuggets). I also had the vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good. It tasted like an In N Out shake, but sweeter. The fries weren't that bad either, I would eat them again. Lastly, the onion chips were probably the best out of the whole meal; they were really crispy and delicious. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back here by choice but it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience. Their staff was friendly and service was quick, impressive since it's pretty full..being on the strip and all. All and all, i say come and try it out for yourself. It just didn't meet my expectations."
D4cPi_H1zetA_T5UYnRNRQ,"I went there yesterday line was long, that wasn't the problem. The problem was there was no communication or organization. They were selling milkshakes and didn't even have them ready me and several other people had to wait a little too long for the rude manager. The lady screaming out the orders was very unorganized and rude. They need a better way of putting the food out when it's ready. And the worst part was when I get home I find out that one of the bags was burnt, it was like somebody left it next to a warmer and was like oops let me just put the bag where they can't see it. Really? You are gonna sell burnt burgers and bags? 
The only positive thing was I did get my 30 burgers quickly and before other people, even though it was BURNT!! Seriously I never had so many problems in one place."
be8sRmiSK7d2LO5k3BR4Xg,"First time trying this burger joint and it didn't disappoint us.  For a family of 3, it was me, my wife & our 3 year old, i ordered the 4 cheeseburger sliders combo and extra 2 cheeseburger slider. I thought it was enough for us, but I had to order a few more lol.  For me its best to eatitwhen it is still warm, everything just melts in ur mouth, and im craving for it right now again while writing this review.

I ordered a $5 chocolate shake too and that was also good!  Their service is really fast and food quality is great, that is why for me, they deserve a 5-star rating.  At the time that we were there, there was a good amount of people.  When I paid for my food they gave me a number, i went to go get my drink, a minute or two after, they called my number right away, so i was very satisfied.

Its a small dining area, so It might be a little hard for you if you come here when there is a lot of people.

When I come back to Vegas, I would definitely come back here."
AGilPZcTb1pdxgZ1abLmMg,"11 years! That's how long it has been since Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about these tiny burgers, and how long I have been waiting to find out if it was worth it.  Spoiler: It kind of is.

The meat is really nothing special here.  It looks preformed from frozen (I could be wrong, but just my observation) and it very thin.  What makes this joint stand out is everything else in addition to the location.  The burgers grill on a flat top coated with onions to soak in flavor.  They are simply made with a couple leftover onions and a pickle, plus cheese if you pay extra.  No frills needed, or really requested for that matter.  The other options I tried were pretty basic type fast food, so nothing special I would go back for.

This location is 24/7 right on the Vegas strip and whether it was noon after a night of drinking, or 4am during a night of drinking - this place is gold! 4 bite burgers that are pretty cheap, freshly made in front of you and aren't super heavy.  I chowed down on 5 of them easily feeling satisfied without feeling sick the next day or really even feeling regret from eating anything overly greasy or poor quality.

In a regular fast food setting it would be just that to me.  A quick bite when I don't really care about what I'm eating the way most fast food is.  On the Vegas strip however, this is probably my new favorite stop during the night or before I get some sleep!"
mz0Os467GFecQktCYaq14w,"I've always wanted to try a White Castle and this is the only place in western US.

The burgers are more like small sliders, so order a few of them. They come with pickles and grilled onions, but they are very tasty!

I also ordered 'onion chips'; Its like onion rings but in French fry form. They are really good.

The service was quick, the prices were reasonable (considering it's on the strip). I would definitely come back."
GwCc7bSP2zWO0d-zFHfteQ,"I've been wanting to try this place WAY before Harold & Kumar made it cool. I was pretty excited to hear that one opened up in Vegas. I've had friends who've gone to New York & eat it & they basically told me ""What you see, is what you get."" 

True to word. I wasn't disappointed though. The line was ridiculous but it went by fast. We ordered almost everything on the menu & it was done pretty quick. The cheeseburgers were pretty good, the fries were lame, the onion chips WERE DELISH, the chicken rings were okay.

I mean, its a fast food place - I don't know what people were really expecting.. lol."
La9r_Z9rGf29pWChpP8nkQ,"Tiny burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS). Good flavor mainly attributed to the grilled onions but these things are small. The patty is paper thin. Makes me wonder if I'm ingesting beef or any kind of real meat for that matter. I'm not a big girl, but I swear I could have killed like 20 burgers (eh hem, really they're SLIDERS) if our group didn't already have reservations for Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse. I was there for Superbowl and this location had just opened so the wait was pretty ridiculous over the weekend but we waited in line in the late afternoon so our wait wasn't as bad.  We waited about 30 minutes and thankfully not in the Vegas heat."
nJWkFWJQE-gdEaAF7gAGMA,"OMFG.... I had low expectations for this place AND it still managed to underwhelm me. I've never had White Castle being from NorCal there isn't any close by. Ordered the #1 combo: 4 sliders, fries, drink. I couldn't even finish all the sliders... didn't want to ruin my appetite for a redemption dinner. 

If you never had White Castle, don't worry you're not missing out on anything. Not even worth a try!"
FiPt3dIVh1Gpavb_RqW4AQ,"If I could give White Castle a negative star I would. I can't believe this place exists. We had a gift card and wanted to try it out. We ordered 40 mini sliders, fries and onion rings. The meat didn't even look or taste like meat, it was horrible. Everything was soggy and not eatable it felt like I was eating something foreign. The best part about the meal was the Powerade. Very upsetting."
tPqW3CRFc8cETcqJ-X1WAg,I'm so glad we don't have these in Niagara Falls. These were the greasiest blandest fast food burgers iv'e ever had and they weren't cheap for what you got.
Zf0jX5faD8ZSkHGJK9MDCA,"The hype was there. I think it was overly hyped but I get it a little. 

We parked at the Venetian and walked outside by where Sephora was at and its tucked in a little casino. But you will be able to see the White Castle sign. 

When we got there the lines were not as busy like we hoped it would be. It took me a long time to come just because the hype made it impossible to come. Thank god we waited though.

We ordered 20 like cheeseburgers sliders. They also has beer for you beer drinkers. They are like I expected little tiny cheeseburgers with 1 pickle Alice and some onions. For some reason it did taste good. But it taste like how the frozen one would taste at a grocery store. 

Although those sliders were tiny I did get start to get full off 3. 

I probably won't be returning here unless one of my tourist family members want to try it out. It wasn't a horrible experience I just feel like there's nothing special about White Castle. Maybe it's better on the East Coast!"
zsJzPkqlJfc3ynlyNu8z5Q,"We drive up from the Phoenix area for White Castle. Husband is a WC freak! I grew up in No Cal, so I only knew from the movies. ;) He says they are far better than the microwave / grocery store heat and eat. We did a drive across the good ol' USA last summer (from coast to coast) and I honestly can't tell the difference between Las Vegas and St Louis. Which is a good thing. They taste the same here as they did on the East Coast."
5xAxkEmNVGmv2TmfkiZFvA,"For starters...for all the people giving it low stars because of the wait they had to endure yesterday (this review is being written the day after the Grand Opening), you're all morons.  Seriously.  What in the world did you expect?  

As far as taste goes, White Castle is not for some.  I can't hate on people not liking it if it's their first time.  I'm also well aware there are FAR more better burgers available, but sometimes you just want a White Castle that is cooked unlike any other burger.  

The burger tasted like I expected, and the cashier, who I'm sure wanted to rip her own head off, was a sweetheart.  Being the lines were so crazy, I asked her if anybody in her team had walked out yet, and she said ""we're soldiers!"".  I loved her attitude, and I wish I had remembered her name.  My gripe, and why it's 3 stars, is with their pricing.  I know it's a strip joint, but there are other chains that charge their regular prices on the strip.  A few steps down is a Chipotle and a McDonald's that charges the same as any other one of their locations.  I don't care that rents are higher on the strip and it's their only location.  Whenever they come into town...locals CRAM THEIR FOOD TRUCKS for their burgers.  They could have just as easily chosen an off-strip location and made a killing off of us.  I split a Crave Pack that came with 10 hamburgers (we paid extra for cheese), 20 chicken rings, and 2 regular fries.  Large sodas ($2.99) were separate.  The bill came out to $38.88.  I'm sorry, but $19.50 for 5 cheeseburgers, 10 chicken rings, fries, and a soda is lame.  For $20, I can come up with 50 other places I rather eat at.  

Also, they offer a combo that comes with 3 cheeseburgers and regular fries for 8.77...WITHOUT A SODA.  That's just wrong considering fountain soda usually has the highest markup of any of their items.  They could've easily included the soda.  

I won't be going back, but I'm hoping that they'll open up some off-strip locations and possibly offer the pricing that other White Castles are used to offering...because at the end of the day...this is White Castle, not Five Guys (or any other burger joint of your choice)."
SgPGp92-OERIN6NljU6Cag,"College at Ohio State and these things were a regular food item for us. I haven't had a ""fresh"" one in 15 years! These were the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Are they kinda crappy? Yes, but if you're from Ohio you get it. You know why we love them. The atmosphere isn't so great, homeless walking up to you asking for money is a bit of a downer when you're relishing your first bite in over a century but it's Vegas, so whatever."
9F3toH7hsnof2rlxWiTnUw,"This place shouldn't receive any stars. My husband and I were looking forward to their great food. When we finally had a chance to go, the service was horrible and the food was worse than hospital food. The burgers meat were tasteless and the fries were soggy. Their soda machine had post-its on every other drink being out of order. Plus, we both ended up getting a stomach ache and the runs that night."
3N37dagJx9bF9IyfzGDj-Q,"Exactly like the frozen, eating them
At 5am in Vegas didn't even improve the taste. Have know idea what hArold or kumar were all hyped about. Shitz wack!!!!"
npKblLYAg3RtkjVmyxXvnw,I never heard of White Castle till I watched Harold and Kumar. It never dawned to me till I seen it while in Vegas. The line gets really long (which is normal on the Strip). They are small portions so get a few.  It is kinda pricey but I thought it was really good. I would choose White Castle over Innout any day now..
1Hr9A4ckCvg3ufpMTKBcqw,Soooo disappointed! Harold and Kumar don't know what a good burger tastes like... sliders tasted like it was microwaved I threw it away I couldn't take another bite. Just thinking about those nasty onions makes my stomach turn ... BLAH!
r_Fc95bp1Dj57wARz6heaw,"It's White Castle and since there none in California and you need your White Castle craving you might as well stand in line and eat your steamed sliders.   It's located at a smaller casino called Casino Royale which is sandwiched between the Venetian and Harrahs.   Some people love these sliders, I'm not a big fan but my boyfriend loves them even bought a 10 pack to bring back to home.   They sell packs of 10, 30 and even 100."
aJZVFuOwomHjlCW6HbdWCQ,"A east coast comfort food that reminds you how sometimes, you need some cheap food to fulfill your needs. It just so happens Vegas isn't a place to fulfill your needs. If your drunk, gambled all your money, desperate and hungry. This is the spot. Other than that if your in the west coast and desperate for some white castle fast food drop on by like I did."
UzFBld958aVBwInqd4HLTg,"The only times I've ever been here is when I / my friends have had a lot to drink.  So from that aspect, its very good drunk food.  The staff is for the most part very patient which I appreciate b/c I know they deal with jerks all the time.

My major complain is the cleanliness of the sitting area which is very small, it can get pretty gross in there and had it been cleaner I would have given it an additional star."
DTFAOD1e2Gbj-Bm6O8wIwg,"Shit, for the price we paid I assumed that when I ate it, i'd taste the damn meat instead it felt like I was eating only the bun. Their meat is as flat and thin as the cheese..... I enjoyed more seeing the options of drinks than I did eating the meal... Fries were not salted and tables were dirty and filled with a lot of mess from previous people."
cfgtXN2T-ULSaFgt72H4bQ,"Right next to Harrah's along the strip.

Sure, you don't have to go to the East Coast for this. On the other hand, you're better off getting something else.

The sliders were alright. Ended up getting the 20-pack with two fries. Add cheese to them and it's a little extra. Also ordered some mozzarella sticks. Total came to just under $40. If you buy the slider packs, it would be cheaper than buying 2 or 3 meals that come with maybe 3 sliders and a drink and fries. Up to you what you wanna do.

It's good to try. But I'm probably going to skip this and find another 24-hour place for something quick."
J0navf62QHjt9IQybSMdHg,"White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot. I grew up with White Castle burgers and I love them. They are unique. They do not taste like any other burgers you may have eaten. They are 'steam' grilled and this gives them a unique flavor and texture. 

If you go to White Castle with any kind of preconceived notions of what a burger is supposed to taste like, you will be disappointed. This is where the negative reviews come from; people who are going to White Castle for the first time who are expecting something different. All I can tell these people is that, unless you've grown up with White Castle burgers, they are an acquired taste. They are the caviar of fast food burgers.

You may not like White Castle burgers the first time you try them. But, after you eat them few times, you'll wake up at 3 a.m. some night and find yourself craving them. Those of us who grew up with them understand this. As I said, White Castle burgers give you the munchies without smoking pot."
YnAumXxywnI5q6GJnANEkg,Oh I love you White Castle! The most amazing place. Only in Vegas can you get a 6 pack of burgers and beer! Sweet combo! I'll be back very soon!
W8ewdzpjHAxtnhmu8E2EVg,"So you're drunk on the Strip and you want that delicious but poor food choice. Yep White Castle fits the bill. The sliders are little bites of heaven which do a great job coating your alcohol laden belly. Being originally from Detroit there was a White Castle on every corner so it wasn't an urgent run to try them when they arrived on the Strip. Being drunk and at Harrah's seeing the White Castle was like a beacon calling us over. The place was packed as we weren't the only ones with the same brilliant idea. The cashiers do a pretty efficient job filling all the orders as quick as possible so expect to wait 15 minutes on a busy weekend night. 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a pop (dammit I'm from Michigan and it's POP not soda) will set you back $8.99 but the extra space it soaks up for more alcohol consumption is priceless. Thank you White Castle!"
I2NzE9YXkK7BRa_7bgtq1Q,So I finally came to see what the hype was. I have had these before on the East Coast and knew what to expect. It was nothing to get excited about but these are pretty good sliders. The staff is amazing about getting everyone through the line and the food comes out quick. So mad props to the employees and their good service. I give it three stars because it just isn't a big deal. Be sure to order double what you think you can eat. Otherwise you'll be hungry. I enjoy it but not a frequent stop for me.
jV-geojy75UXZoMJMlbjzQ,"Well, well, well-- another burger joint in Vegas. And guess what? It's affordable, especially after an intense session at the slots or tables! Or if you had ''too much fun'' at the clubs.

Location:
This burger hot spot is located near the Linq, across from Mirage-- it's literally next to ""Margaritaville'' or whatever. But definitely easy to spot (look for the castle structure sign).

Interior:
This is a typical fast food joint. Need I say more?

Food:
The burgers were pretty small. Being a Hefty Hannah that I am (inside and out), 5 burgers & fries would probably fill me up. I kid you not, I could probably fit 2-3 burgers in the palm of my hand. Compared to Shake Shack & In n Out -- this place is.... different. If you're into small & soft burgers-- this is the place for you. Also, I really like how the cheese is always melted in the burger (that's total perfection). However, the squiggly fries were ""eh."" Same with the chicken rings-- I could pass on both and stick with the CHEESEBURGERS. Oh, and be sure to ask for the sauces with your burgers-- it definitely makes for an exciting twist. Between the other burger spots, I would choose this place because it's one of those, hashtag cheap eats -- and bragging rights of ""OMG, I ate 10 burgers!""

Service: 
It was alright. Nothing to complain about.

TLDR:
This place is great for cheap burgers-- comparable to McDonalds, but better. in flavor and MELTED CHEESE! Burgers are small, so order A LOT (5-6 per person).


Turn Ons:
- Cheap
- Melted cheese
- Super small KAWAIIIII burgers
- Sauces
- Opens 24/7 (I think...).

Turn Offs:
- Fries & Chicken rings (ew)"
aT_P9fCo9L-jmVSs9J4kHw,"I was very skeptical to try this spot because of all the bad comments I got from my friends before coming here. But I liked the ones that you buy from the freezer so that was enough for me to give it a shot anyway. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it wasn't great either. Surprisingly there's always a line specially past midnight. I'll have to be drunk to eat here."
kHlEtBlwSvoxNea0EMQX6w,"White Castle is Whites Castle. Always sounds like a good idea when you have had a few. And it's good at first. Then come regret and gastric distress. But that's what you do. But when it's super busy as this location, and it takes forever and it filled with people even drunk than you. Probably way drunken than you it's just not worth it."
n-s5ldtAJp-8Stj5qjnJxw,"I'm a native new yorker and this couldn't be better I gave missed this, onion rings look different but it all remains me of home . thank you"
JztXi1Oc-PDTO6A1U4_x-g,"Went here on a busy Saturday night and there was ONE PERSON taking orders and over ten people on the assembly line - extremely poor management of man power.  There were workers goofing off or just blankly staring off into space.  I felt bad for the guy taking orders.  

Food wise: sliders were OK, nothing special and definitely over hyped by the movie Harold and Kumar."
Y2ww9W3vjepRjihHqnOkxA,"After years of eating the frozen burgers from the grocery store, I finally got to try them in person in a real location. I'll be honest, these are not the best burgers I've ever had - nor are they best sliders either. But hey, they're tasty and they get the job done. They're pricey but that's common in Vegas, but I must say the sliders with cheese are delicious. Their chicken rings, yes ""RINGS"" are delicious as well. So if you find yourself nearby while walking the strip and need either a small snack or full meal, try it. 
It's not the best burger in town, but it's a tasty for what it is."
sPdArgGQSCEhHGZ3OPcYew,"The Las Vegas restaurant is in a tight location. It's a small place in which the restrooms are located next door in the casino. Although they seem to have a sufficient number of tables. 
Orders are placed at the counter and your number is called when the order is ready for pick up. At the time of my visit the order line moved slowly because only 1 of 3 registers were open. The order was filled quickly even before I reached my table. 

Being from Chicago what can you say about White Castle other than ""It's an Institution"". But in Las Vegas it becomes another choice in the growing Burger business. Glad they are here because fresh is better than frozen and I won't have to satisfy the crave when visiting Chicago. Buy them by the sack.
 
One difference here is that they do not have onion rings. They have onion chips. These are basically rings that have been cut into pieces. Just as good as the rings. Just place several on the slider."
NIROBiHn7KT3frfdJJyoxg,"Ok if you are DRUNK, HUNGOVER, OR GONNA BE.  These rock.  If not they are kinda grease pits that sit in your gut.  My friends had issues with the onions I did not."
M44jYdh9LEuBasiWUafcUw,"My bf is from the east coast and was beyond excited when news broke of a White Castle coming to Vegas. Being from California my heart belongs to in n out. That being said, their sliders are pretty good for the price. The sliders are on a soft pillowy bun with grilled onions and pickles with the option of cheese.

We received a text 3 days before the official opening date stating that White Castle was giving away free food. Within minutes we were out the door and made the 20 minute drive to the strip.

When we got there, there was caution tape preventing us to enter the restaurant from the casino, but we were able to see the entire restaurant. We saw kitchen staff making sliders and contractors making finishing touches. We figured that they would give away all the sliders they were practicing to make for the grand opening. After being told that they were only giving them to casino employees we decided to hang out for 45 minutes hoping for the chance they would have extra for us. We even offer to pay for them.

The patience paid off and we went home with 14 sliders and fries for free!

The customer service was amazing. Curious casino patrons would peek into the White Castle and sure enough an employee would come over to answer questions and encourage them to come back in a few days when they officially open. 

They open Tue, Jan. 27th at 2pm!"
m-o_gjEyaRERXCK_krSbiA,"We came Sunday 5/28/17 at 4:30 pm on our way home. The fries were the best part of the meal but let me tell you, nothing special about the burgers. We have had White Castle in New York and my husband was excited to try it here in Vegas. 

We BOTH left (my husband and I) with FOOD POISONING and we BOTH ended up in urgent care on Memorial Day and still too sick to return to work today! Right now is my second attempt to eat since eating there Sunday. 

I will NEVER eat there again! I have been burping up those nasty onions for two days! Ughhh! 

I will stick to the regular White Castle on the east coast. Lesson learned....."
T-p5xYc1dFdq_mKlHsoZsg,"This was my first White Castle experience. 
I had tried the frozen ones before and didn't care for them and was assured by many that I had to try the real thing.  

I was excited that White Castle had opened in Vegas since it was more likely that I would make it to Vegas than the east coast.  Final the Vegas trip was booked and I was excited to try out White Castle.  

Flash forward to Sunday morning.  The breakfast debate begins and me and my home skillet decide on White Castle.  Since its Vegas it's open 24/7 so why not!  White Castle is located on the strip in the Casino Royale.  The store front is located on the strip and easy to find.  

As you walk in it feels like any fast food restaurant.  Ordering was quick, easy and friendly.  We ordered the 2 person combo with 10 sliders (5 with cheese, 5 original), a fry, an onion chip and two soda's for a little over $20.  Our order was up pretty quick.  They do require you show your receipt when you pick up your order.  I'm sure this is a safety measure as I can imagine as day turns to night and the party animals are on the loose there has been previous burger burglaries.  

The moment has arrived the tiny little boxes of meat onions and bread is before me!  I take my first bite and.....it's alright.  I figure it's a east coast thing.  I'll stick to my my west coast In n' Out.  The restaurant itself was good, I can't blame them for my taste buds being born and raised on the west coast. 

Moral of the story.....try it, you might like it, even if I didn't!"
JzEytxYVxPQQ8hllzHnGSA,"Nahhh dude, you must be outta your mind because this was not worth the west coast adventure..."
9xLPhqutFRsOG8M4mpxBUg,They are what they are - greasy little piles of goodness.  The pickle and cardboard box adds the missing pieces that the frozen ones can not provide.  If you grew up with them then you know what I'm talking about.  For first timers they probably won't be to your liking and that's fine too.   Cut down on the fat by removing the bottom bun.  It soaks up the majority of the fat.
4IMVoNFHmCx9pyO4cWn7jg,"Terrible food. Chicken sandwich was just a piece of fried chicken between two buns. Absolutely nothing else on it.
Double burger was better but still unsatisfying. Garbage"
lE3nnM8qCX4fglUQT0lgVw,Go to the Mcdonald's just a few minutes away if you want a cheeseburger.  The sliders were pretty gross but the mozzarella sticks and fries were great. This place is overhyped for the taste and quality.
7jeXytiPbcTTMOo3VBU_Yg,"Many years ago, I visited a White Castle back east (once) so I knew what to expect, but we decided to give this place a try just because it's new to Vegas.

Before I get to the food, I have to mention that the two cashiers were both visibly annoyed at the customers in front of us, and they treated the couple two spots ahead of us in a completely unacceptable manner, simply because they were new to the menu and unsure how to order, making an annoyed face and screaming ""NEXT"" to get to the customer behind them. I was sure to place my order as quickly as possible (we ordered the #2 cheeseburger, fries, and drink), so at least the cashier appeared to merely tolerate me as I paid. This place has only been open a few weeks and the employees at the front are already burnt out. What's up with that? With so much unemployment in Vegas, couldn't they have found a few cashiers who are a bit friendlier?

As for the food - well, it's White Castle. It is what it is. Tiny, thin burger in a plain bun, with a bit of cheese and onion. There's a burger in there, but can anyone really taste it? I estimate the ratio of bun to burger is about 8:1, so you'll have to eat a huge amount of bun before you get much burger in your tummy! The fries were just bleh.

About the location - I'm not sure where to park to get into this place. There is no parking in front, so we ended up parking in the Venetian and walking back to the Strip, but surely there's a spot closer than that? Also, there were TWO security guards working this location, which only amplified the negative vibes in this place. And our table was damaged enough that it made eating uncomfortable - such a shame at such a new location.

Not recommended."
HhZwGpr3hpJYDyyRmeUgYg,"I first had the honor of noshing on these edible miracles, while attending the U or MN (Twin Cities), beginning in 1969 (Sliders were 12¢/each, then).  I had a ""dry spell"" (living W of the Mississippi River) until I visited NYC in 1976.  Since then, none.

Now, it's like a prayer has been answered in my favor, and I can once again re-live my college days, even though I am now 65 and can't down the 20 I used to put away at a single visit in the 1970s.

I have a friend in Meadview AZ who's more ""addicted"" to them than I am, so if he has HIS way, I'm sure he'll be traveling the 218 round-trip miles every weekend, and crying when that's not possible.

While I'm glad they have finally opened an outlet in the Las Vegas Valley, I only have one question regarding that:

WHY didn't you open one here, in the 1970s?"
pR8Gq04HYJdENFetmqB4wA,"Like everyone else, I was super excited to try this place after watching the movie ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"". Sad to say that I didn't enjoy the food very much. Ordered each item from the menu and the only good thing was the little chicken sandwich. Services was good and fast though."
6ZjELVX-kHkEzTVqV503tQ,Nothing to go out of your way for. The sliders honestly sucked. Cool that it was open late but not worth the wait. Onion fries had really no onion
2vDaUAYOEgn2mnXJEO7_kg,"This is not much of a burger. The meat, if you can find it is so small, you can't taste it. Although I pulled it out and tried just the meat. It was flavorless. The buns are wet. Not moist...WET. Even though you watch them cook the burger, it presents like a frozen, microwaved something you by in the frozen section at the supermarket.

Fries? Yes, they have fries. Again it's like they microwave them. That's just how it is presented. The fries, crinkle cut, are barely cooked, soggy, and served Luke warm.

I know this place is popular on the east coast, but from what I can tell, I am not sure why."
4Mw-gScvCjdf9VoRXTV4fw,"I only expected better because we have these in St. Louis.  It took them forever to get our order prepared and then it was wrong...so disappointing.  once they got it right it was good.  However, the wait was way too long and I wanted it right the first time."
JJvuprjoGcUTvZIBZgaAiw,"I'm not sure why the bad reviews. I mean it's not the best burger I ever had,but it is pretty tasty. Doesn't taste anything like the microwaved version of the chain. For what it is it does the job. It's a little pricey but I would eat it again next time I'm in town."
qStu3fXgajhkfRhNXX83yw,"I was in live for an hour last night when finally got to cashier to make my order I got 2 regular no onion and no cheese and  10 jalapeño no cheese- none where jalapeño and all cheese - all burgers ended up in the trash - 1 AM you know I was hungry ! Lost my appetite when saw wrong order -I try to call the vegas number and no way to be transfer to manager no one picks up. Left 5 messages no one bother to call back !!

No excuse to take bad order !!

Hire none experienced young kids to work !

Bad bad and bad !"
uxf9EId3tZFRtA7VMoBe_w,"I finally made it to White Castle! Located on the busy strip of Las Vegas, the only White Castle on the West Coast(ish). This small shop is located next to the Harrah's on the east side of a small casino. As you may already know, parking on the strip (if you are coming from off the strip) is a pain in the butt, but if you are coming just to have White Castle I would choose a hotel/casino near the Harrah's.

The restaurant is pretty small and narrow. Once you walk in there are a few tables including one really long table with seats on both sides of the table. The counter is in the back of the restaurant. The menu is pretty basic; there are a few combos that include the sliders, fries and a drink, sliders that are being sold by themselves and also options to order large amounts of sliders! 

We ordered a regular combo, but added a few more sliders to our order. They came out quick and hot... and they tasted just like I imagined a fresh White Castle Slider would taste like... my childhood nostalgia. I easily packed away like 7 sliders without blinking, but boy do you pay for it later.

I have friends that have visited the Midwest and told me that White Castle was delicious, but gives you gnarly gas... and boy does it! You have been warned."
T0vDAcf6bDpmvGI-XvwIsw,"I grew up on the west coast, so White Castle is a relatively new phenomenon for me. I've been here at least 3 times, and I have to say that it tastes the best after a long night out.  This is located in the Casino Royale casino, in between Venetian and Harrah's.  This past time we went, we tried 1 of almost every slider available. Here's my personal ranking from best to worst:
Double cheese slider 
Original slider w/ egg and cheese 
Cheese slider 
Fish slider and veggie slider
Chicken ring slider and chicken breast slider
I hope that makes sense. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken sliders. The fries are a must here, especially when they're freshly fried. Also, don't forget to ask for all your sauces at the counter when you pick up your food! The food usually comes out pretty quickly, so don't be discouraged by long lines!"
93wATH9XsUWe3hzc0uY-gw,"OK, let's calm down here, people. It's just White Castle. Is this really something to get excited about?

If you happen to be in the area and you want to try it for the first time, be my guest. I would skip the fries if I were you. The onion chips are a much better bet.

Sorry, vegetarians, but there are no veggie sliders to be had here. Rise up and be heard!
(Tip: they're made by Dr. Praeger's and they're available in fine grocery stores everywhere.)

No matter what you eat or don't eat, you probably have dozens of better options that you could walk to from here.

""The Crave Is A Powerful Thing""? Well, then I guess it doesn't matter what I tell you.

Bon appétit."
9_M4HICgAvNyZVqd2ltTug,"I seriously don't understand the hype.

I went on an adventure to just to get here, and I was fairly disappointed. The line wrapped around and almost reached the dining tables. The wait just to order took about 30 minutes, and the wait for the food was about an additional 20.

I ordered a bunch of cheese sliders and original sliders to bring back to the hotel for my group of friends. Needless to say, my first White Castle slider will probably be my last White Castle slider. There was nothing special about it, and I definitely was not impressed. The patty was incredibly thin and I don't remember it tasting much like anything.

I will consider trying the one on the east coast, but I will not be returning to this location."
AiV8qr-bpLsqKwFnsGgkRw,"Am I gonna wait 45min for 4 mini burgers and fries after the club..? Hell ya! So I'm not from the Midwest and I didn't grow up on these, but I gotta say, these small hamburgers are damn good. Every time I come into Vegas I always get them after I've been out. The line can get long so be prepared to wait. These little patties are like basically sliders with thin meat and chopped up onions, catchup and mustard and a pickle. They are pan fried so they do retain a little more fat and grease which is why they taste so good. I do love their fries cuz they are extra crispy."
b-gDuSChBO5chsDbV9cpVw,"If not for the movie, I would have never tried this. I regret it. White castle is straight disgusting. Its expensive for what it is too. Don't waste your time... McDonald's is head and shoulders better. Hell, so is Burger King and that's saying a lot!"
WY-eLmQKz0_ACYnXhnEwDg,"Ahhhh a familiar taste! This is the only location in Vegas! I am glad they have one from where I from (St Louis) they have them everywhere! I have read some of the reviews and I must laugh at some, this place is not a five star burger place, they are called ""Belly bombers"" for a reason! They a quick snack food and great late late at night or early am, or beating a rough night before. I LOVE white castles and will continue to go back they are great and I am glad to have them in town!!!"
4FqsBoJmLVo2DIkfjJ_rAw,"Zimmerman's is my local grocery store, and while I try my best to avoid going there (for various reasons) somehow, I end up there a few times a week. 

The reasons why Freshmart is inferior to other grocery stores:

- They never ever have sales on anything. No flyers, they don't accept coupons, they are getting the most money from you possible

- Their selection sucks. I have been there many times that they've had no ground beef. COME ON! Ground beef?! Really they just don't have enough of anything! 

- Their deli service is questionable. One of the workers scares me a little! I haven't seen him around recently though, so maybe they figured out he scares the customers

- The cashiers are touch and go. There are two (I think they owners) who are really abrupt and unfriendly. Then there are two younger people who are super friendly and personable. If you have a choice, go to a younger cashier! 

- Cleanliness - not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but this place never seems fully clean... 

So, if you have an opportunity to get a drive to Metro, do it. The sales there will also be better priced than Freshmart, which makes it worth the journey. If you have to go to Freshmart, just be prepared to pay through the nose for your every day needs. 

.. and you'll likely see me there."
f-XxmFo1_s6ZlNnGWOUK8g,"I think this might be the unhappiest place on earth. It never seems to have what I need, has bad prices and the staff seem miserable."
cxK8kHDjcfP0Ps8x_k34bQ,I have been a loyal customer of Freshmart for the last few years. I just noticed that they have filled the void created by the closure of European Quality Meats and Sausages. Freshmart now carries their full line of products. The only difference their meat counter is self service. You don't have to take a number and wait. As to their prices they have without question the cheapest prices in the area.
E641VZBrsJhXumIw515-3Q,"This is my local grocery store, and it is arguably the worst grocery store in Toronto. Why?

- Understocked: Half the time I go in there, they don't have standard items like 2L 1% milk or cottage cheese.

- Expired goods: When they do have what I want most of the time the expiry date is 1 week away. It's very rare I get what I want with a reasonable expiry date.

- Highly overpriced: Everything from soda to toilet paper is way more expensive than even Metro or Loblaws.

I used to be a huge opponent of Loblaws opening a store near Kensington, but with this being our only option, coupled with the fact that 90% of the stores in the market are only open until 7-8 (and even earlier in the winter), the people in this area sorely need a reasonable grocery store open.

If you happen to be unemployed, Kensington would be a great place to shop. But for people who work until 5-6 and then have an activity after such as going to the gym, shopping in Kensington is an impossibility. It's extremely frustrating."
1KWbBdZeVqMomOYiNqpwGA,"Sketchy looking place at a first glance and it is indeed sketchy. I have had money stolen from a cashier (Kalsi, a middle-aged woman with brown skin and is roughly 5' 5"".) working at Zimmerman's twice in the past year. The first time, I let it slide. The second time, I contacted management (Martin Zimmerman) and he simply ignored me.

Just so that others do not get scammed the same way I do, I will describe how I had money stolen. I gave her a $20 and after she put the bill in the cash register, she claimed I only gave her $10. When I insisted otherwise, she got hostile and accused me of trying to take money. What she will tell you is that the manager will count the money and if there is surplus, she will contact you. An obvious workaround for her is to pocket $10 before the manager counts.

If you are paying with cash, I suggest you have the cashier identify the cash amount you are giving her. Have her verbally affirm that she sees the amount you are giving and better yet, record it with video."
3T86_chXUV_eeYjmUKD6ug,"Closest thing to a typical grocery store in Kensington. Not too big but they'll have most things you'd need. They never really have sales, but the prices aren't TOO bad. Obviously you'll want to get your produce somewhere else in the market. Open until 7pm.

Obligatory Title Pun: ZIMMER down!

Menu Readability: Oh, so not applicable.

Need to mention: Minimum order of $10 to use your CC or debit.

What this place teaches me about myself: I moved to a part of town with absolutely no grocery stores."
bfwd5RKurZviDcHyGCQSeQ,"Major props to Zimmerman's for being open on Christmas, NYE and Thanksgiving!

I stumbled into Zimmerman's one Christmas while searching for baking trays. I had gone to Chinatown in the hopes that something that would be open would sell baking trays, but sadly my hopes were mercilessly dashed. Zimmerman's being open taped up the broken pieces of my heart!

It's a normal grocery store and seems adequately stocked. The prices could definitely be lower: I was happy to pay for the premium of being able to buy things on Christmas afternoon.

You can't use debit unless you purchase $10 worth of goods, but that's understandable at an establishment of this size. 

The owner is a friendly guy and runs an A-OK grocery store."
Xzqz2lwPWJhhMOXjV9c0IQ,"This store hasn't changed in years!  It's still the depressing and overpriced store that I remembered from my earlier years, but I stopped in to take a browse since it has been a long time that I visited.  No wonder it has been a long time!

The interior is a decent size with spacious aisles and some-what stocked shelves, but selection of brands is limited. The way the shelves are setup so far apart, makes the store seems a little bigger, definitely lots of room in the aisles.

Location is convenient if you live in the neighbourhood to get some staples in the market that other stores doesn't offer. If you don't have time to go to one of the bigger grocery stores and don't  mind paying the higher prices for convenience, then this store is for you.

I'm really surprised that Zimmerman's has survived.   I wonder for how much longer?"
eGcoe4CbyIrmvhFoKCMvHg,"I am laughing so hard right now after reading the Edie review where she mentions the staff are ""disabled"", I, personally, hadn't noticed, but I'll look more carefully next time, maybe that cute blond that just started working there has a hidden peg leg.... I think not.  

The only thing I really buy here on a regular basis is milk.  Most other things you would need such as toiletries and cleaning supplies you are much better off buying in bulk at a wallmart, if that notion doesn't offend you, and buying your meat and veggies at smaller stores in kensington market."
tFf1QKZ8MR6gIC4Z2ekDVg,"Sadly, my wife and I attended last night's wine and art exhibit.

We arrived to see a roped off area in the hallway outside the Art Exhibit.  A small walkway had been left for those smart enough not to have ponied up the $30 plus per person to be served 3 very un-tasty wines. A red, a Brut, and a Chardonnay.  

We have had much better free wine tastings at Trader Joe's and a couple of liquor outlets here in town.  On top of that, these free tastings also had cheese, crackers or nuts and chips to nosh on whilst you were sampling those free wines.  Last time, Trader's offered 5 different wines, and the liquor store offered 4.

The wine tasting started at 5 pm, and the exhibit did not open till 7pm?  Well, there was a long period of wine sipping on an empty stomach before being herded into the exhibit hall and being allowed to crowd around 3 separate paintings.  My wife in vertically challenged, and did not want to have to push her way through a crowd of wined up aficionados, to get a glimpse of the image as it was being talked about.

We walked away with a bitter taste in our mouths from the bad wine and the old style vegas treatment of people like cattle.

Ahr7sNdGkNsDgOK3N4yRwQ,"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small and in any other big city, $15 for a well presented, but small Monet exhibition might not be worth the time or expense. Yet after walking up and down the Strip for a couple hours and repeatedly reminding myself of why I'm not a Las Vegas type of guy, this Gallery was a welcome and peaceful respite. With the audio guide in my ear, I enjoyed the overwrought explanations and wandered back and forth as I actually tried to learn something. It was an enjoyable time, and I was actually sorry that I had to go back and brave the happy hordes again."
yRuhN1lSAeFVD3qWtbuW5g,"A touch of true (not manufactured) French impressionist art in Las Vegas. This city keeps on pleasantly surprising me. 

The Monet exhibition is on view through January 6, 2013. This exhibition showcased 20 works by Monet and eight other works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro, and Eugene Louis Boudin.

February 2013 onwards we can look forward to a Warhol series. 

The gallery itself is pretty compact, the audio aids provided are quite easy to use and the gallery doesn't seem to get too crowded to allow enjoyment of these exquisite works. Although I have to mention that the audio provided quite a lot of useless information rather than descriptions of the art work and the artists. 

Strangely enough, in addition to the gorgeous art, I was drawn to the walls of the studio that were painted a stunning purple!

The cost of a ticket here is around $16 for adults ($13 for locals) and children under 12 are free. Pretty reasonable for a priceless experience. 

It's nice to partake in these creative gems without taking an international flight. If only this were a little bit bigger....think the Art Institute of Chicago maybe? We did Smith Center...now for a large museum (that's not mob related) Vegas!"
RaSU-d08Y2ywamgI3TOeRA,"2 stars for the Andy Warhol exhibit's value in my eyes.

$13 for locals, and it took us about 10-15min to walk through the entire place, taking a little time to check out each piece of art and reading the commentary.

Can't say this was my style of art, but if it was a different artist or set, I could probably push the venue up to a 3-4 star review.  But since it's not, I have to go with the value in my eyes, which was pretty low. 

I came here for the company anyways!  LOL"
O467QnXRMUhGezSU7y1VPQ,"Bellagio prides itself on being one of the best luxury casinos on the Vegas strip thus I promptly expected it's art gallery to be up to par. I came to Vegas for the 4th of July weekend and noticed that they just recently opened a Picasso exhibit titled Creatures and Creativity. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to visit. However, it was far too crowded. I came back to Vegas about a month later when it was far less crowded and came by the gallery. 

I like to think of myself as a modern art aficionado; I am especially fond of Rothko and color blocking  which is very different from Picasso's style. However, this exhibit boasted 43 works and regardless of whatever modern art movement you prefer this exhibit will not fail to impress. This collection contained a series of works inspired by his wife Jacqueline. The whole exhibit will give you a deeper appreciation of Braques and his cubist movement. I can't recommend this gallery enough. Go to it to take a break from all the slot machines and general chaos found in Vegas. Enjoy."
LusBkJWi2sweY6dtwGOOmA,"We went here with some friends for the Picasso exhibit and it was great. They have an interactive headset feature where as you walk around you can hear a short story and description of each of the beautiful paintings as you are in front of them. The staff could be a bit more ""customer service"" oriented but I guess standing around all day staring at the same paintings does get to you after a while. It does provide a great history of his personal life and his inspirations for each of his works of art."
AUmXOCngwD95fbxpLZ7s9Q,"I went to art school so of course, I love art.  I've been to many museums such as SF MOMA, NY MOMA, LACMA, MOCA, Chicago Art Institute, Musee D' Orsay, Louvre and more.  I've been to BGFA in Bellagio a few times when they had Gaugin, Picasso and the latest, Andy Warhol.

We got there at 7:30pm and they were closing at 8pm.  We were told we only had 30 minutes - yeah, I figured that much.  I also knew we would only need less than 30 minutes.  This is a teeny tiny gallery so even if I stared at every single piece of art and read the notes about each piece, I wouldn't need 30 minutes! For $13 per local, this place isn't worth it - you're not getting your money's worth at all.  You can see more art in other galleries in other cities for $15.  We were done in 15-20 minutes.  They also don't allow photography. I've taken pictures of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre without a problem...yup, MONA LISA...LOUVRE! Something's not right. The gallery feels so stuffy and humid...might not be the best environment to keep art in.

However, the lack of culture and art in this city, I feel obliged to like this gallery since I have no choice."
C2NWUKCA1iRn9yjvCSnyug,"It is sort of a failsauce art museum.

However the Bellagio itself is an incredible work of art."
TMOdkyUoT6Fcv96UhkpF9A,"I like the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts, enough that I renewed my annual membership today.  I don't go as often as I should but I can and will--well not if history is my guide.

I know the space is small and I realize they charge too much for admission given that fact.  The audio tour wand included with the admission is almost worth the admission price.

The current exhibit--A Sense of Place:Landscapes from Monet to Hockney is small with a limited number of paintings and other art.  The quality, however, is excellent.  Many of the pieces are on loan from The Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Some are from the Contemporary Museum in San Diego, and a few pieces are from the MGM Resorts collection.

I didn't have all that much time today, so I did the audio tour and moved quickly through the exhibition.  Since I have the membership for a year, I can go back another time and spend more time studying the individual works and learning more about the artists.

Again, I know the place is small, but at least we have a fine arts gallery.  With the Guggenheim closing and the West Sahara Library Museum closed, we need something like the BGFA.  It is worth having."
2aAE1ZVDqMgFDakrl7iRAw,"Great exhibition of Monet's work. it's a little small, but then again it is an exhibition gallery and not a museum. It's fair priced and the atmosphere is great. The staff is very friendly and seem well educated on the matter. Lastly, a complementary audio guide is given to you as you access the Gallery providing some information and a little background of art on display."
CEQntA6gKstMsyXi_L6b6A,"I love museums and I have been wanting to go to this gallery for quite awhile. I finally got the opportunity to go on Saturday and I was kind of disappointed at the quantity of art for the price, which is $12 for locals and $15 for tourists. There were pieces on display from artists such as Clemente (one of my favorites),Lichtenstein, Degas, Renoir, and a few from Picasso among others. In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls.  In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork. I feel like this was the Bellagio's attempt to add to it's ambiance of  refinement by adding this gallery which ended up just feeling like a cheap novelty of a museum. I'd rather go to the Guggenheim next time i'm in New York and get more bang for my buck. But hey, i'm a thrifty girl who usually pays $5 on suggested admission prices so take from that what you will :)"
QzZ3DcS59X8d6SUcaDT9ig,"Love art in all forms.. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art currently has 43 pieces from Pablo Picasso till January 10, 2016. I was expecting more than a Picasso collection but that pretty much it. Two rooms storing a number of his paintings for $19. Definitely not worth it. I could of seen this or researched his paintings online. 

A definite must skip. Enjoy the gelato place next door."
COq5EpcUGJsDnzgNl64flg,"Before I start the review, I wanted to address the biggest complaint I read here: The size of the gallery and the number of artworks here.  This in itself raises an interesting question.  What is the ""value"" and ""worth"" of admission of an art exhibit to a person?  Do 3 paintings justify the price?  30 paintings?  Do the artists showcased play a factor?

Granted, I took advantage of a ""Free Admission"" day, so I didn't pay the requisite $15 dollars.  It's only 4 rooms, so it took less than an hour to complete, but I did see some beautiful pieces there from the ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"" exhibit.  Some from Lichtenstein, and Nara, and Picasso, Degas, and Renoir.  Certainly, viewing the works of these artists has to be worth something.

And it's not like the gallery doesn't change its exhibit at least twice a year.  The staff was friendly enough and didn't follow you room to room; an issue that I had at another (now closed) museum here.  There are locals and student discounts.  It comes with a free audio tour.

So what is the price of viewing art worth to you?  If you like the artists and get a chance to see their works in person, shouldn't that be at least worth some value to yourself?  I've been to bigger and admittedly better museums, but I did enjoy my time here.

When the exhibits change, I'd be glad to come back.  And yes, I'd actually be fine in paying to do so."
j_rNGMwRLlQo6Mfle1-bBA,"Las Vegas is not known for it's museums and other artistic endeavors. This is one of the few places where you can come to see really great art. I've been coming to this gallery for many years before I lived here. It was one of the few things I actually wanted to come to the Strip and do when I came to visit my sister who has lived here for 20 years. 

The Art - They try to do at least two shows a year. I've seen some great art while out here. Don't think you are coming to the Met or something. This is a small small small gallery, but you see some great works. Right now is a Warhol exhibit, which I found pretty interesting. Some have bashed the pieces shown, but I've seen several Warhol exhibits so it's nice to see a different side. I just love art, though, so I'm usually always happy to see anything.

Cost - Tickets are $16 but what can you expect in Las Vegas? For locals you can get half price on Wednesday nights. I went ahead and bought a membership, which allows me to go as much as I want with a guest. I'll put it to good use too. 

I suppose I could give a four star but really it's just kinda ok. If you are use to bigger museums then you may be disappointed. I was also disappointed that they turned the gift shop into a store to buy over priced prints. I really like being able to buy something small to remind me of an exhibit that I've seen. Oh well, another reason why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars. 

If you love art then I'd say go. If  you are only ok with art, maybe go ride a roller coaster or something along those lines. You might be disappointed."
9OZYO2oT-h4PDxOqh7t6Fg,"I have visited this museum 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years. Fortunately, my husband can occasionally get us in for free so that's when we go. Like this past weekend, for example. 

The current exhibit, which runs through January 2012, is ""A Sense of Place."" But the sense I got was that they just threw some paintings together to try to fit a theme. I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up. 

It starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up. 

The last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a ""Sense of Place"" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot. 

I really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head. 

A few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars. But for now I will say, don't bother (unless you are seriously in love with art)... and let's wait til January to see what the next exhibit will be."
i-LtjqKlaCwlRrw4a_ID5Q,"Very disappointed! I was expecting more for the price. 

The museum is EXTREMELY small for the $20 ticket per person. It is only two rooms. Very, very small. Very disappointed. 

If you are not interested in the artist, then don't bother coming. They change themes every 6 months or so; just like other museums, but this one is extremely small. Not much variety... I mean, there is no room for variety I guess."
u3hLhwmpPXsBZn8rcLLG1w,"Wanted to see the Farbege exhibit. Student and resident discount

Smaller than most exhibit I've been to but it's always fun to see history.

A bit of a walk from lobby but the hotel is beautifully done."
xlq5VU5Ry6O4hmA-xpAamA,"I'm a bonafide art lover who lives in the art wasteland that is Las Vegas, so I'm super happy and grateful that the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art exists in our town. I support it every chance I get and I never miss an exhibition. The exhibitions change only a couple of times per year so make sure you call to find out what's currently on display.

I love that a free audio tour is included with your admission. Make sure you pick it up because it's very informative. The gallery itself is super tiny. Even if you are expecting the small size, you'll still be disappointed. The exhibits only have a few pieces on display but it's better than nothing. The curator here is big on having a certain theme or artist on display for each exhibition. We've had Monet, Warhol and more general themes like Women Painters. Allow 30 minutes to an hour to view the exhibit. You won't need more time than that. 

The museum offers a local's discount certain days of the month. It changes so call ahead, but tickets are reduced in price from $13 to $8. The gallery has monthly wine discussions in the gallery too where you enjoy wine pairings and talk about the art for around $40 per ticket. Photography is NOT allowed in the gallery."
yOgNtJCPvXqOC9zvy8iWhg,"The Gallery is a nice alternative to the stereotypical Vegas activities. I was here for the Warhol exhibit. 

For the size of the of the exhibit and the cost, I wouldn't recommend it unless you love the artist. General Admission, out of state , is $16. This is high considering you can go to MoMA in NYC for $25 or the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburg for $20 and see his work as well.

You could walk through the show in 5 minutes if you didn't read the picture placards or listen to to hand held audio device that was included with admission."
yHiPXSLLKmbtIAVt0EUnGw,"My husband and I went to see the Warhol Out West exhibit, as I am a big fan of Andy Warhol. While it is a small gallery, and a bit pricey for the size, I loved the pieces chosen to be part of this collection. They had his famous Campbell's soup cans, self-portraits, American Indians, snapshots, moving installations, and a few diamond dust pieces -- all-encompassing of this amazing artist's different works. I loved all 45 minutes of my audio tour as well. I recommend it to those who appreciate and love Andy Warhol and would enjoy a refreshing activity outside from typical Vegas madness."
t7xOZF5UKXjSpVcXLOSAgw,"I have been there. I believe more than once. 
I was not in awe by this gallery.
It was Ok.
I thought it would be bigger and have more art, and flair.
I guess not.
I am glad it exists, I guess its good to have a touch of historical fine art in a casino, since the city of Las Vegas has very few fine art museums."
W9NLc2sqSnm1jz_UONk_uA,"Whether or not this is worth the price of admission depends a lot on the current exhibit and how big a fan you are of that art.  When I visited, they were displaying works (mostly) by Monet which were loaned by the Boston Museum of Art.  This is actually the second time I've seen this exhibit in Vegas, although they had different paintings each time.  The first time, about 7 years ago, was the first time I had seen Monet's paintings in person and I was blown away.  This time, although I've now seen his works in Seattle and in Paris, I was still pretty happy with the exhibit.  The only disappointment was that they didn't have any of my favorite pieces.  The space is large enough to feel like you aren't caught in a crowd, small enough that you can see everything in a reasonable amount of time, and the audio guide worked well.  If you're up for a little culture with your vacation of sin, and the gallery is showing something you're interested in, it's definitely worth stopping by!"
HBHqo5jPYByPOA_JN8mdcQ,"Families are not welcome in this gallery - strollers are not permitted and they will not store them for you.

Not worth the money, and if you read their website they don't even guarantee to be open during their publicized hours.  Don't even bother going here!"
r24xJihAJPWFBJpD7IlYFg,"As a huge Warhol fan, I was pleasantly surprised at what this exhibit had to offer.  Small but a well rounded display of all that is Andy Warhol.  The polaroids being my favorite part.  I also appreciated the free phone gadgets that explained in detail the background of each piece.  

Being an Art major and from an area that offers maybe a little too much culture (Washington, D.C.)..  Little gems like this make me so happy.  I missed the Monet exhibit but will be back for future displays.  Oh, and the local discount was cool, too!

If only they served wine and/or champagne.  Didn't they get the memo that wine and art are a killer combo?  :)

**Please note:  Absolutely NO photography is allowed.  Andy Warhol never allowed photography even if it was taken without a flash. So BGFA respectively made sure to follow his wishes."
wXw0MtB3rbqPTPcrEZjhaQ,"Small but fabulous gallery.  Favorites include Eugene Louis Boudin's "" Venice, Santa Maria della Salute from San Giorgio"" and David Hockney's ""Garrowby Hill"".  A must-see if you're on the Strip!"
BBRuWvBceYX0C-wTq487gw,Went to the Warhol exhibit.  Save your money and buy the coffee table book.  For the price they are charging you should be able to get in to a real museum.
dVATKzsLNxou4fTMyaM_1g,"First it should be said that this is an art gallery in a casino.  While it may seem an odd note to begin with, it seems that many people have a few overblown expectations about it.

With that out of the way, the gallery itself is a small, four-room affair, with a very silent feel to it.  The exhibits are arranged in number order to correspond with the free audio tour wand, which has an explanation of a few of the things to look for at the piece.  The gallery changes themes about twice a year, and is actually quite well-curated.  Rather than being a giant art gallery, it has more of the feel of a small artist's gallery, and is themed as such.  

The only thing holding me back from a 5-star review is the price.  It is simply too expensive for many people out there, and a lot of them will feel cheated for the money.  At a stout $15 per person, it can seem a bit pricey, especially with places like the Met at NYC can be entered for a mere $5.  

I think that this gallery is to be relegated to being a locals gallery, since they can get a discount (even more for students), and it is one of a very small set of galleries in the Las Vegas area.  This being a casino, each part must make money, and I guess the only way that the BGFA can do so is through exorbitant prices."
XPRj-PHG5Q0LtXKFGtmHSg,"Always consistent. I've been here several times for different exhibitions. Intimate, quaint and a nice alternative in Vegas."
iGkP8sKX4x6g-6_03y-taQ,"Disappointing. While the Warhol exhibit is interesting, it is an extremely small display for the price. We'd heard about the Gallery for many years, and it didn't live up to the hype. 

I'd recommend the Mob Exhibit at the Tropicana; much better value and highly recommended."
VahWU9HtToYtLt5_PAFk0A,"OK, so when I was there they had Monets. i think that earns a three star rating all by itself. They did have a couple significant pieces, but in general i found the gallery a little lacking. I can't say why, I was just expecting a different level than I experienced. Everything aside it was an opportunity to be up-close with over a dozen Monets so I would probably have to do it again."
IbNmBKk2Ln8I0s0BVZR4lg,"This gallery is beautiful! As an art history major finding this hidden gem was just amazing. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Balagio. 

I was lucky to be in town for the Picasso installation, and we're talking before Picasso got into cubism Picasso, which I personally believe to be the best from him. They had beautiful pencil portraits of his and I just couldn't believe how remarkable they were. Such excellent quality. I also enjoyed that even though this gallery is small, there isn't a lot of people in it all at once so you can take your time with all the art and people won't stand in your way to see them."
PUyYbVdWDHCHRbVnVSd-EQ,"I am not the standard Vegas traveler.  I don't ride a scooter holding a cigarette and oxygen tank.  I don't wear an upside-down over-sized visor while clutching a yard-long margarita.  I don't go to clubs in my shiny shirt.  And I don't get my perv on at the topless pools.  I have absolutely nothing against those activities, nor those who seek to participate in them.  Honestly, I don't.  People are free to seek out whatever kinds of carrying-on makes their trip an enjoyable one and there seems to be something of an agreement that those I previously described can be seen as among the most popular, they're just not my idea of a good time.

No, when I'm in Vegas I'm there to eat.  I do a little gambling.  A little shopping, maybe.  But the focus of my three-or-four-times-a-year sojourns in Sin City are focused on great food and wine.  Las Vegas has positioned itself as a destination for the gustatorily inclined, amongst which I count myself and my small group of friends.  So there you have it.

But what to do in-between meals?  What indeed?  It's a puzzle, isn't it?

Thank goodness, then, for the Bellagio Gallery of Fine art.  And while not incredibly well curated, it does at least have interesting pieces on display whenever I visit.  They usually let an exhibit run for 4-6 months or so, and though it's never anything TRULY exciting, it does at least offer a welcome oasis of high-culture in a desert of debasement.  

You'll never see anything as outside the mainstream as a Jason Rhoades installation there.  I don't think any Richard Prince retrospectives are in danger of being hung, but I did see some nice O'Keefes, Marsden Hartleys, and an Ashille Gorky on my last visit.  There have been Picassos, Cezannes, and Monets in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that.

The space is a little cramped, which gets in the way of appreciating pieces at varying distances, and the flow of the space is a little odd, and maybe the paintings are grouped a little tightly sometimes... but I'm willing to forgive these little transgressions as grateful as I am to have something besides an 80-foot high mural of a showgirl's ass to gaze at while I'm waiting for mealtime to roll around.  Not that... well... you get the idea.

As long as you manage your expectations, the 17 bucks you will drop for admission is pretty good compared to what that same amount will buy you out on the casino floor.  Go on, get some culture!  It's good for ya!  There will be plenty of time for scooters and 'ritas and showgirl-ass later in the day.  Trust me, there always is."
lY8W0bUqMHeL0cPeNoIPmg,"Totally worth it if you love art and need a bit of culture in your Vegas trip. The exhibit area is not large, so don't be expecting a big museum. We saw the Painting Women exhibit and it was very nice, lots of great paintings and some artists I had never seen before but will be looking into when I get home. I think it was about $20 a person, expensive but not for Las Vegas--everything's expensive here!"
d071KoxemOg21L9iLAZ3ug,"My husband and I were not big fans of this gallery.  We both walked out and said, ""That was it?""  We were expecting a lot more.

We went there with high hopes for the American Modernism exhibit.  Actually, we were really looking forward to it.  See, my husband is an art professor at The University of Texas, so art is a big part of our lives, and we were really looking forward to the artists they advertised as included.

The price was super expensive to enter.  I paid less when I went to the Prado.  This was no Prado, believe me.  It consisted of two rooms and one video room where they were showing a relatively cool video on Georgia O'Keeffe.  But other than that, I'd skip it.  I felt like we paid $17 to watch a 20 minute video."
k3aclaqIMx4lNLZ9D1Dp2Q,"I went to see the Warhol exhibit, they had a limited amount of pieces.  I'm not sure if they were real or reproductions.  Which puzzled me.  I kept looking close and the numbers next to the name said 2 of 32, so I'm guessing they were special limited repos.  I'm not an art expert or anything I just wanted to see Warhol's work in person."
tLAlemZPUtcM_4cAMllhPQ,"I apparently am not enough of an art lover to appreciate the enigmatic sparseness of this one room display on the human form....translation: ummm..where is the rest of the art in this place?Gift shop is as big as the gallery. 

It is a nice reprieve from the Blackjack table. So for that they get two."
xE4zehqbECke0Xevslw7cQ,"I was interested in coming here because they were exhibiting works by Picasso. I think Picasso's work is pretty cool.

This a headset guided tour. I guess you can just walk around if you want, but I highly suggest experiencing this in they way they've set it up.

There was plenty of information given in Picasso's artistic processes as well as details on his love and personal life.  Be aware that there are no photos allowed to be taken.  

If you are an artist you will gain new knowledge on different techniques and I'm sure become inspired.  For the art lover like me, you too will be pleased.  

I should note that this was an extremely short art exhibit so you may not be so happy with that. For $19.00 and being held inside the Bellagio I guess this was reasonably priced. At a larger museum this probably would have been an exhibit add on for around $10.00.

Me and my husband got in for free using My Vegas points so you can try that too."
GEN2pInABf5NuCOmTpuJ1A,"I had gone to the Monet gallery and wanted to return when they got a new artist in, although it is small and doesn't take long to go through, I found it interesting and decently priced. When I had heard that Andy Warhol art was coming into the space I was excited to go check it out. I enjoyed seeing both galleries, but I would say I spent more time in Monet. It held my attention a little better and was all around just more interesting to me. I think everyone is different and some people might think vise versa of my opinion and I can see that, but I would definitely recommend going to check out the gallery no matter what art is being displayed. Its a great locals night out (dinner, gallery, drinks) and something nice for tourists to do too, to get away from all the gambling, smoking, and drinking (even if it is only for an hour or so).

jznMQRl6cprB3-eEaPJRhA,"The Picasso exhibit was a nice distraction from the Vegas craziness. We went early afternoon on a Thursday and there wasn't much of a crowd inside. We were able to enjoy the exhibit without feeling rushed and the audio guide helped a lot. 

The exhibit seemed a lot smaller than the advertised amount, only because some of the paintings were part of a series and it showed the same piece develop over time. 

They offered a discount for M life members and at $16, it was was a great break from the craps table."
nSXiQiQFgLHT3TCBAomdQg,Went to see the Warhol Exhibit this weekend and I can't believe it was $16 for 15 minutes (or less) of Andy art. They give you a telephone remote thing so you can get more information on each piece if you like. The exhibit was super small. Only did it so I can say I've seen his original work but unless you're a crazy Warhol fan I'd say save your money.
j5jXl4GiRissanLZmLVLpw,"***************************** 1363 ***************************

   Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art is small gallery located right across the Bellagio Pool. $18 ticket but if you are M Life Platinum/Noir member like me, you got 2 free tickets :-)

   This time it was the Pablo Picasso private collection from his son. Picasso: Creatures and Creativity - On display July 3, 2015 - January 10, 2016. The exhibition features over 45 of Picasso's paintings, linocuts and lithographs spanning the 1930s - 1970s. These works showcase Picasso's extraordinary ability to capture the human form with his use of line, movement and color. Highlighting his ability to create portraits that vary from realism to the highly abstract, the exhibition reveals Picasso's evolution as an artist over a 40-year span.

   It was quite amazing to see the different from one to another right next to each other. 

   A few things you are not allowed to do here, unlike other museum where you are allowed to take photos with no flash, not here. 

- Strollers are not permitted in the Gallery.
- Food, drinks, videotaping and photography of any kind are not permitted in the Gallery.
- Use of cellular devices is prohibited."
Pm8fO81B9g9zp_iaJCquXQ,Not worth the 15$ admission. I've been to galleries around the world and have a minor in art history and the Lichtenstien Warhol and friends show was the smallest collection of minor works I've ever been charged for. We were very disappointed.
FFTOVdrCrWqwdNDLDghzSw,"We spent about an hour walking through here to see Picasso's paintings, lithographs, and linocuts. It's a small exhibit, which really encourages you to just walk through and listen to each clip of the audio tour (which I typically never do in larger installations). I didn't know much about Picasso aside from his more popular paintings, so to learn about his lithographs/linocuts, was really intriguing. A linocut is like a giant stamp. Picasso would create entire series off of one linocut, which he would stamp once, then cut into and stamp again. Repeat. In one way, it's a bit heart-breaking to know that he just had the one linocut, vs having dozens of them to show the series..but that's kind of what makes it really beautiful."
C7mrSDEveEdmMo9pbp2DfQ,"It's nice to see some genuine culture amidst the tacky bling of most of the trip. I saw an exhibit titled ""Figuratively Speaking: A Survey of the Human Form"". The cost was $12 for locals and included an informative audio tour. It led you through 4 rooms filled with paintings, sketches, mixed media and photographs, including pieces by Picasso and Renior as well as more modern artists. True, the museum is modest, but I thoroughly enjoyed this display."
97C5vltEDTT2V53ASWrFkQ,"I'm not an expert on fine art, but I can appreciate something beautiful, something that has survived for centuries, and anything with historical significance.  So anytime there is an art gallery nearby, no matter what the exhibit, I do enjoy stopping in to take a look.

My husband and I were passing some time on our last day in Vegas while waiting to leave for the airport.  Figured the art gallery would be a nice, relaxing way to spend an hour or so.  Entrance fee ($17) was relatively inexpensive, surprisingly, seeing that everything else we'd done in Vegas up to that point had been rather pricey.

I can't remember the name of the exhibit we'd seen - it wasn't anything too famous like Andy Warhol (earlier this year) or Faberge (coming soon).  But the paintings were mostly early 1900s it seemed.  We were also given little handheld audio devices where we could listen to more information regarding maybe 20 of the paintings.

The only issue I had with the gallery was that it was rather small.  Maybe 3 or 4 rooms.  We definitely went through it in well under an hour, and when we got out we were like, That's it?!  Not that a gallery can't be small; it's just not what we were expecting.

Art galleries are my go-to thing to do when I run out of other things to do.  I would definitely go back again if there was an exhibit that sounded interesting."
eddI1vaGbjIIcWrfT9he5A,"I really love this bit of culture driven by the finest absolutely priceless art hidden in the back of the Bellagio. Most never make the trek down the long hallways to get there. But, if you appreciate some of the world's finest art, along with an incredible adjective and adverb filled audio guide pulled from the largest thesaurus available, I'd really advise coming here. 

Once, we were lucky enough to take in an Andy Warhol exhibit. It was incredible! Pop art didn't exist before Andy's era. Wow!

Another time, we saw a Alexander Calder exhibit. Did you know he invented the mobile? In other words, before Alexander Calder, nobody on the planet had conceived of creating hanging sculptures that move in the slightest breeze! These kinetic art forms now grace toddlers cribs, enormous atriums, airports, and wonderful spaces the world over! They even had his one true transitional work, where the mobile was hanging within a traditional picture frame. He then broke from the confines of a frame and centuries of art history and moved his art in to the open where it could rotate, move and be seen from all angles. Truly inspiring!"
6dUXKtS2U59I8-NM04ExJQ,"The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art may not be comparable to galleries found in major metropolitan cities, but it's a much appreciated gallery that Las Vegas is fortunate to have. It offers visitors the opportunity to view artwork by renowned artists.

Finding the gallery can be an adventure. Being a local who's somewhat familiar with the layout of the Bellagio, I've never seen the gallery before and had to ask for assistance on its whereabouts. The gallery is tucked in another wing in the Bellagio, away from the boisterous sounds and excitement of the casino. If you know/can find Cafe Gelato, it's within close proximity.

Here's a rundown of the current ticket prices:

General Admission:  $16
*Nevada Resident: $13
Students, Teachers, and Military: $11 (High School student IDs only)
Children 12 and under: Free

*Nevada Resident prices are $8 on Wednesdays only from 5:00pm - 7:30pm. 

I came here on a Wednesday to take advantage of the $8 Nevada Resident price, which I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have paid the full amount to see an exhibit. Like some reviewers have mentioned, the gallery is very small, and you'll be in and out within an hour at max. There's a free guided tour device that makes me feel like I'm Zack Morris talking into a brick phone. It's complimentary, and I'd suggest grabbing one because the plaques don't have much details about the art. 

For art lovers, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art might be a good place to visit, but  for someone who's only mildly interested, I might just skip it all together and view the art online instead."
sYd4f0dgLeElXYqACHq1wA,Just saw the Faberge' exhibit. The art and stories were fascinating. The exhibit hall is beautiful and the staff friendly. The docent was very knowledgeable. We were excited to see this because our daughter is leaving for Moscow for 16 months. The price is reasonable for locals and students.
cDP2RNpmkOt7dliqqsVvsQ,"Skip this.  I visited Bellagio Gallery of Fine Arts while they were having the Mohammed Ali collection.

1. I was scammed out of an extra ticket cost.  I have a Buy One Get One Free pass, but was charged me for two tickets anyways.  Upon bringing this up, she wrote ""Returned 1"" on my receipt and said I'll be refunded.  I had to call them later to get the refund.

2. The cost of entrance is $16 for hotel guests or AAA members.  $18 otherwise

3. Use myVegas app 4000 credits to get a buy one get one free

4. The art gallery is 2 big rooms and even if you spend time looking and reading everything, you should be out in roughly 40 minutes.

5. When I went, they had a Mohammed Ali collection.  Autographed items and replicas of things he used.  It's cool, but it's not fine art.

Maybe I'm just the type of guy that doesn't appreciate art, but it was NOT worth $18.  Even at half the price, $9 is not worth it."
arCOtK7HooCkqAaGPik1TQ,"The Faberge Revealed exhibit at the Bellagio Fine Art Gallery is not to be missed if you enjoy exquisite craftsmanship. The exhibit showcases over 200 artifacts from Karl Faberge and other jewelers from Russia. This traveling exhibit on loan from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is amazing and will be in Las Vegas until May, 2015. The exhibit features four Imperial Easter eggs. The eggs demonstrate the intricacy of the exceptional design and artistry. Also included are Faux, Faberge look alike objects that have been available over the years."
tlXgX2PjqpOjp23QPymx6A,"This gallery was small and expensive.  Sure, the quality of the collection was top notch, it is after all, in the Bellagio.  If they lowered the price to $10, it would be a little bit more reasonable.  

My main gripe is that they won't let you take photos of the art work.  not even without flash.  The paintings were made before copyright laws, so I don't know what the big deal was.  

I doubt I'll come back unless if I could get in somehow with a discount."
VMeWS4vvYIgT-KcMgiydFQ,"A nice place to take a breather from the fun and frivolity of Vegas.  I've been here twice --- once for an exhibit of impressionists when the place first opened, then again for an Andy Warhol showing.  It's a lovely little museum.  In fact, it was Julia Roberts' workplace in the movie, ""Ocean's 11.""   The admission is reasonable.  The place has a gift shop offering a lot of cool ways to introduce your kids to fine art. Definitely worth a visit.

gLpbyI8iqMzqWflRr5MT5Q,"We saw a very good show on the architecture and design of City Center. The docents were very helpful. One offered to get me a pencil and paper to take notes. The audio guide could be more informative, but it was fairly decent. The gallery is a good deal if you are a Nevada resident. They offer a special locals night on Wednesdays for $8 per person. It is a bit small, but consider that a plus if you wish to get in depth with the exhibits."
biGscyV55Og_AEn1hY23Bw,"This was my first visit to the Bellagio Fine art gallery. I heard they were showing some of Pablo Picasso's work. I was excited because I was looking for inspiration for my personal fine art photography projects. It cost $16 for locals and they offered free audio headphones (I declined the headphones). It took me all of 10 minutes to walk through the gallery! I felt very disappointed and cheated with the small amount of work they had on display. Even the Cosmopolitan hotel had more art to see inside of their hotel... And it was FREE! Not that money is a factor, but for $16 there were too many empty wall space in the gallery. It was still pretty cool to see a few of Picasso's paintings. Not many can say that... But I doubt I'd go back."
6WTnCPxgHOQp0N3svC5t4Q,"$15 general admission to a small gallery. 
Select few good pieces but not really worth the price."
si9eS4wZImzzWzHCHf7sFw,"On 9/20/17 we experienced the Bellagio Art Exhibit of Muhammad Ali.  The public cost was $18 per adult and children 12 and under were free.  We used the Las Vegas Power Pass, so this attraction was included.  

The exhibit included 2 smaller rooms displaying some pictures and stories about Ali.  You can also receive a device which tells you stories while you progress through the exhibit.  In addition to the pictures, there were a few displays containing artifacts of Ali.  Most of which were reproductions.  

It took about 15 minutes to go through the exhibit, but we stopped listening to the recordings pretty quickly and just read the information and looked at the artifacts.  

Unless you are a die hard Ali fan who wpuld like to see reproductions and have some cash you want to waste, I would recommend skipping this exhibit and look at the photos I provided, they pretty much show what you would see.  

However, if your in the area and have the Power Pass or received free admission, then go for it."
7nV8KINW2U7c_P2xUVmJTQ,"Last month I went to see the Claude Monet's Impression of Light exhibit. And I was so delighted to be there. The gallery is small and compact but right to the point. It was a very intimate experience. The audio tour was also very nicely done, not too much information but just enough for you to get a good understanding of the painting. I can't wait to see what the gallery has to offer next time I come back to Vegas"
M4Ktaj-KP020JjdObAKCfA,"Everyone knows that when it comes to all things Las Vegas, it ain't cheap. I can't find a single better example than the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. Yes, it might be fine, but there's no reason to pay a hefty fine to see some 25 or 30 pieces of art. It costs $15 for non locals and $10 for students. Yes, they do have works from Picasso and that fact alone saved this review from being demoted to a single star. 

Save your money and go to the Richard MacDonald gallery of art based on his sculptures of Cirque du Soliel. Ironically, there are more works here and they are insanely detailed and quite amazing. 

Oh, and this gallery is also free."
q7m_Vb6jINNxVuJK4BHwZA,"I came in with a friend to check out the ""Warhol Out West"" tour.  I'm not a huge Warhol enthusiast, but I really enjoy several artists that were inspired by his work.  So we figured we would come and check out the original.  

Let me first say that the Bellagio cannot really control what the Warhol people choose to display.  So I won't hold this against them.  But I will say that the pieces chosen were odd.  None of them said a whole lot about the artist.  And that gets me to the other failing, there wasn't much to look at.  There were three small rooms with relatively bare walls.

At first I thought the ticket prices were decent, two of us got in for 24 dollars.  However, after getting through the exhibit in just over fifteen minutes, I couldn't help but feel let down.  More than ten dollars for a few minutes of glances, and nothing jumped out as inspiring or monumental.  

The audio tour included was dull, and rambled on a lot about things that weren't too important.  And there were also an absorbant amount of security in the place, lingering over our shoulders the whole time wondering if we were taking pictures or not.  I get that important art must be protected, but so many guards ruined the immersive experience one is supposed to have while at a gallery.

With such an alluring figure as Warhol, I went in expecting to be entertained.  I wasn't concerned about the ticket price.  But after leaving feeling more than unfulfilled, I had to wonder if maybe it all should have been a bit cheaper.

All this said, I'm glad the Bellagio is displaying art.  And I welcome other exhibits, hopefully on the more interesting side."
4jAJgSWPilBVjRgDxoN_dw,"We came to see the Picasso exhibit. There weren't many works but it was beautiful, I highly recommend to get the audio tour (it's free). The gallery is not kid friendly nor stroller friendly. It's small and I don't think there was proper security. We got tickets from the MGM hotel special ""3 attractions for $57."""
lzfmEW7ZHNVNs16L4puQZA,"Skip this.

They just have two rooms worth of exhibits. About the size of two living rooms. So when you pay about $18, you would think they would put at least the best art in these two room, but not so at the BGFA.

For example, I came here for the Picasso Creatures and Creativity. They had way better art at the Picasso Restaurant then at the BGFA. At least I had a fine dinner and got to experience several paintings rather than random sketches at the BGFA.

No matter how much I tried to stay as long as I could to get my monies worth, I spent only about 15 minutes at the BGFA. And that was a stretch."
xQY8N_XvtGbearJ5X4QryQ,"As someone who has worked with many museums, I was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!

Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call ""cozy"" or ""charming"" - basically any euphemism for small.

That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:

* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.
* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.
* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to ""just look around"" and ""do whatever."" 

At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling."
lIM8s9Zir1v142YwLH7pvA,"The largest collection of Monet art on display outside of Paris!!!!

(at Bellagio through January 6, 2013)

We just happened to stumble upon a poster advertising this Monet exhibit. How lucky was I since Claude Monet has been my favorite painter ever since I was first introduced to his work in 2nd grade!!! You bet I was freakin excited! (Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces).

The gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display.  We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that.

I was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot).  They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see.

Some of my favorites from the gallery were:

Grainstack (sunset)
Meadow with Haystacks near Giverny
Meadow with Poplars
Antibes Seen from the Plateau Notre-Dame
Charing Cross Bridge (overcast day)
Entrance to the Village of Vetheuil in Winter

There are a couple of security guards, as one would expect. But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum.

A superb exhibit -- if you are you a Monet fan, you mustn't miss this! The orchid-colored gallery walls really set the mood and complemented the art.

THANK YOU, BELLAGIO!! =)"
sLkT7J06L4TK4PiRUFax2g,"One of the few places in town you can view work from renowned artists and this place charges like its the Met. Maybe that's a bit much. But then again so is $19 for a two room exhibition no bigger than your local Starbucks. That's like paying $50 to go to Coachella to see ONE band play ONE song. It's bullshit, right? It is not worth the admission for most of the exhibitions they show. If you're a local, $10 on Wednesdays is a bit more reasonable... but discounts are only 5-8pm which doesn't really make much sense."
RjCHRDNnI6v4a8NSiHsi5A,Don't waste your money.  They hype it up to be something large and worth seeing but it's not.  The exhibits were small and not worth the high admission fee.  I even used my student discount and still thought it wasn't worth it.

Conveniently located center strip in the Bellagio.

The Gallery has two rooms.  

One room had a class of 10 yrs old kids complete w/ an excitable teacher talking sht about art while waving hands and saying stuff like ""Look at those brush stokes!!!  I want each of you to think of three questions about those brush strokes!!!!?

""Yo man, I just made some mad MONET up in that blackjack table""  is not  real slang.

The brush strokes are actually quite impressive.  So are the dots. 

The audio tour is worth it.  The music playing over the narration is ostentatious.

Steve Wynn dyes his hair/whitens his teeth, and visits tanning salons. He also appears to favor ""luxury style"" decorating.  Which is boring.

I liked the exhibit and was glad to have it. Good use of purple.

I wonder what kind of landscapes monet would paint if steve wynn sent him to vegas.  Fatasses on electric-mobility-scooter/wheelchairs is my guess.  They're everywhere.  Quite the contrast visa v sienne blending into the sky with young woman in purple."
DDzSrpio3kNKjOemYCBuUQ,very nice! We saw a very well put together exhibit with very famous and not as famous art. well worth it!!! There were families there but parents were carefully & respectfully educating the children on the att.
l-cdzXuQ1BFuex_jwqj8sA,"The Bellagio's Gallery of Fine Arts is one of those visits that you need to make whether if you're local or a visitor.  Reading the reviews on Yelp is very helpful before visiting BGFA.  And if you're reading this now, you passed step one.  BGFA looks like a fairly sized exhibit on the outside, but don't let that fool you.  A couple of steps inside and you're wowed with the fact that BGFA is small.  This was my thoughts the first time I've ever visited BGFA.

Prices for the exhibit is about $15 (current exhibit is $16).  There's local nights which is half price, which is big deal. Once you're in you're given an audio hand-held and can tour BGFA at your own pace.

I've been here for the Monet Exhibit, which I thought was fantastic.  I loved it and even paid the full price because I forgot locals get discounts.  My most recent visit was Andy Warhol's exhibit and this time got in during Local's night.  Regarding the Andy Warhol exhibit itself, it's really not for everyone.  You have to be a fan of Warhol to love this exhibit.  And even if you're a huge fan, you need to keep in mind that only a select pieces of his artwork is displayed here. In other words, your favorite pieces may or may not be on display.  I once dated someone that was a huge fan so you can say I was forced to love some of his work.  

PS: When you exit, don't forget to stop by Jeff Mitchum's Gallery.  His work is on display or you can review his books that showcase his art. Some comfortable seating too."
eCVfvEa6ZTvi_yuA3LZZrA,"I went here to view the Andy Warhol exhibit.  The exhibit was short, just a few rooms.  They had some of the most phenomenal pieces.  There were styles that I had never seen before, and the explanation was quite detailed.  I would simply not go here expecting an exhibit of the Art Institute of Chicago proportions.  You may feel like you overpaid a bit, but you're in Vegas so the gauging shouldn't be a complete surprise."
C2sH6mmxrrRWnF4uR_sZEA,"It's a small museum, but every time I've been here I've been impressed by how well organized the exhibit is.  It is worth the money.  As others have said, this is not an all day experience.  But if you want to get some culture to balance out the debauchery of vegas, this is the place to do it."
tFwFlusKNRosEaIEMmeRag,"Warhol was unconventional, his art was pop, accessible over the top, warm, happy .... The Bellagio exhibit is cold, sterile, lofty... the exact opposite of Andy's philosophies. I think he would vomit. A major disappointment. Warhol's art is amazing and powerful... but the Bellagio exhibit is disjointed and odd. 

We just returned from the Andy Wahol: 'Warhol Out West' exhibition to open at Bellagio."
4OADaU5e2p63-bSPqtyc7w,"(I have only been to one exhibit here, so until I see how other exhibits fare, 3 stars. Also, this is a piece I wrote for a magazine that never published it.)

""People either love Andy Warhol, or they hate him"" quipped Warhol Out West exhibit tour guide, Gina, ""And I think he loved that people felt that way about him.""

It's easy to see why people feel so strongly. In today's world of Instagram filters and Photoshop, people may look at his work and say, ""I can do that!"" or ""that's not art!"" But don't let the simple or mundane of Warhol's style fool you. He spoke about society through his work in a very tongue-in-cheek way.

The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art's showing of Warhol Out West, is currently displaying 59 pieces of his work on loan from The Warhol museum in Pittsburgh, the birthplace of Andy Warhol. 

From the famous soup cans, to screen tests, balloons to ballroom dancing instructions, the exhibit has a little bit of everything from Warhol's work. Also included in the collection are less famous works, such as his Polaroid pictures of celebrities, which have influenced the likes of celebrity photographer Terry Richardson, or Warhol's rendition of American Master Charles Schreyvogel's ""Breaking through the Line.""

Portraits of Geronimo, Annie Oakley and General Custer, along with others from the ""Cowboys and Indians"" collection, are on display. It is in this collection that Warhol's critique of society shines through. 

When the docent turned to the small crowd gathered around her, she asked ""So what do you think of Warhol's work?""  Two people on the tour had competing ideas about it. ""I just love how he could see beauty and form in the everyday piece and elevate it to high art"" and another observer, ""We're standing in a five-star resort, and paid money to look at balloons and soup cans. This was clearly one big joke to him and one big eff you to pretentious people in the art world. He turned his joke into a money-making deal for himself. Good for him.""

For those unfamiliar with Warhol's work, this exhibit is the perfect chance for you to pick a side - was Warhol serious about his art, or was he making a buck while simultaneously saying through his work, ""don't hate the artist; hate the art game?"" You decide.

Audio tours are available all day and docent led tours, which are highly suggested, are offered every day at 2 p.m. Tours are free with admission. $16 general admission, $13 for Nevada residents, $11 for students with ID."
d1kCr-MjOvF23e9wUNbK2g,"We generally visit this gallery while in Las Vegas and this trip was not an exhibit.  Make sure you receive an audio wand which will make your visit that much more enjoyable.  The current exhibit, ""Town and Country: From Degas to Picasso"" was organized in conjunction with MOFA in Boston.  I did not feel many of the works on display represented the featured artists, including van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, and Toulouse-Lautrec, best work though the informative panels accompanying each work of art and the recorded description (see audio wand) proved to be interesting."
pSo23PvrhsbUiLKD16q0Yg,"One of the best art exhibits I have ever seen was an O'Keeffe Stieglitz presentation here; it was so personal and detailed.  Really an in depth gorgeous experience.  This was a few years ago.  

This time it was an exhibit on the human form.  Although it was much much smaller than the O'Keeffe exhibit it was nicely put together with notable pieces from Renoir, Picasso, Hockney all the way to a Cindy Sherman photograph.  Good variety, but small.

This is one of my favorite places to go in Vegas and will go every time I visit; LOVE IT!

P.S. It is so f-ing LAME people complain about the price- morons!  It costs $15 for a sandwich on the strip and 3 seconds to loose $15 gambling STFU!"
w-TFszvXdVnWwzk2LDZzlw,"I hear that they also have other attractions in Vegas, like gaming.  And shopping, and fabulous restaurants, and pools with plenty of sunshine.

However, my primary reason for visiting Vegas is the art. I first attended the Impressionist show at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art about five years ago, and was duly impressed and surprised by the scholarship and selection of the work.  As a former museum professional, it made sense that Vegas would have the money to pay for the crating, insurance, and exhibition of priceless works of art.  Having worked at a major Modern art museum, it was also a pleasant surprise to use the audio tour to hear the level of scholarship that was available to the casual art viewer.

I have seen every show at the gallery since the first show. My first stop in Vegas is this gallery, now that the Guggenheim branch at the Venetian is closed.  I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature.  There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint.

 One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble.  The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated.

I do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price.  However, as an art history teacher, I have had to buy museum memberships in order to see large shows at major museums, not to mention the added costs of parking and transportation to reach destination cities.   This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal.

This gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum.
These shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind.

The book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding."
UVadisNW1ABn0yWGeun1vQ,"I use to come here a lot, every Wednesday if 50% off for locals! The only problem is that this place looks in art... I know this is not LA or NY, I'm not asking for a real art gallery, but this is Bellagio!!! I'm expecting way more, or make it free !
Andy Warhol collection was disappointing, with only few of his work pieces..."
UaAX9nU5ivwRftl1YBV2dg,"The works of Picasso are impressive and very profound. We arrived 10 minutes before their last tour. As soon as we walked we rushed to view all of his art because they were closing soon. Make sure you don't wear a coat to the gallery because it's humid. I had a pleasant night alongside my best friend, we enjoyed seeing a variety of his work and the metamorphosis his work went through, throughout the years. I find his work to stir many emotions and constant battle though surrealism and the steady depth in the color and canvas. I am the happiest girl on earth to see his work before they left to his family estate in Spain. For my first time viewing his work and standing to it so closely, I felt as if I was at his house, and Picasso opens the door to his villa and welcomes us delighted to show us his passion and inspiration. 43 years later he will forever be one of the greatest. I do have one small complain and that was the woman who worked inside the gallery of who gave us attitude thought the entire exhibition, she constantly displayed her negativity and couldn't stop staring. I hope next time she doesn't interrupt us, she was rude."
JtIj2QzqUTWWpbYOFnyZ0w,"Saw the Andy Warhol Wild West Exhibit here and it was so cool!  Ive seen his other work at the MoMA in NYC and those were also rad. The work shown here, however, is probably not as popular to the public as those shown at MoMA.  We were given an audio device that you hold up to your ear and it plays information regarding the artwork.  It was nice to hear the history behind the art and really made me appreciate it more.  My favorite  were the polaroids that Andy Warhol took of celebrities and of himself - so perfectly imperfect. Very small gallery though. I love art so this was a nice treat for me and worth the $16 general admission."
jwwA14czaSKTbxMKXA574g,"I appreciate art, but certainly not a sophisticate.  Or rich.  Wanted to come here because the exhibit was Women in Art, so brought my two young daughters.  My family has visited several art museums across Europe, so I knew the girls would be interested.  I knew the price before visiting.  Kids are free and retired military was $11.  What makes me give it a meh was the size of the exhibit.  There were probably 30 paintings, 20 of which had audio (with an included audioguide).  Hard to spend more than an hour there, which might be nice for the casual observer, but disappointing when you factor in the value.  Normal admission is $16 - for comparison's sake, entry to the Louvre is 12 euro, about $16.  There are two Georgia O' Keefe's in the gallery, and to me the most impressive pieces of the exhibit."
6DVVPTX-VkZysxE1FyIiqQ,"I was very impressed by the Yousuf Karsh exhibit. Included with admission is a self guided audio tour. All you have to do is dial the number next to the picture into your handheld device and you can hear a short narration. The Icons of the 20th Century exhibit is on display until 9/5/16 so be sure to stop by.

There's a small gift shop located adjacent to the ticket booth."
xJdw-F7mm7RgMX6Y6H8fAQ,"Me personally I didn't like it all it taste weird to me and it smelled like a dead animal n my opinion I will not return to any because it's just not for my taste buds the staff was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and suggestive selling... The lines can be long but that's expected need more setting...it was pretty clean 

Overall I rated it 2 stars because of staff...."
nt3j8SAGcZLi2zTdr7BbFQ,"I had only ever heard legends of White Castle burgers whether it was through the Harold and Kumar movies or the frozen versions at Albertsons. I was pretty excited to learn that White Castle was fairly new to Vegas so the hype was intense. The line is crazy and the menu is like nothing i've seen before. You basically order for the group or small orders for 1 person. Obviously we went for the 20 burger combo with fries and the chicken rings. Seeing how the burgers are made is mesmerizing. The kitchen is pretty open compared to other fast food restaurants where large machines cover the process. White Castle however lays everything out for you to admire and salivate while you order. They cover the grill with the chopped onions and then place the patties on top. It is definitely a sight to see. 20 minutes later, we got out food which was well worth the wait. Those little sliders are so delicious and fresh. You almost feel bad as you count how many you eat from the 20 burger combo. The onions are probably my favorite part. The fries are really nothing special and i would not order them again. The chicken rings are pretty good but are pretty basic tasting compared to Burger King's. I ate 6 sliders by the way..."
hXxxaRuh-OU3EdOcyth6EQ,"This iconic bigger chain popularized mini slider burgers.  I found them fairly tasteless, skimpy, and unsatisfying.  Going in I had very low expectations of the burgers but even then I was not satisfied with the product.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I will definitely not be going back."
z1lVUD9zpDxtGInbSdyfzA,"The atmosphere is very loud and crowded joint. The casino is next to the restaurant so you can hear people gambling and making noise. I instantly noticed this place was popular due to the large line, so I was intrigued to see what all the fuzz was about.

Ordered items: Combo #2 which came with 4 cheese sliders, some fries and a drink. The burgers were nothing special. They were good, but I will definitely not go out of my way to get these burgers. I would say 4 sliders are equivalent to 1 full size burger. 

I was told this place is the east coasts in-N- out. In my opinion, it doesn't come close. The concept is interesting with the sliders, but the overall quality of the burger Isn't great. 

Overall, it was an interesting experience. The line was too long and the burgers were average. I would recommend you only try if the line are short and you're very hungry."
3bMbB5NfWz0VngFx4lsrgw,"WHITE CASTLE --- Not worth the wait--
 I was so excited to have a white castle open in LV like so many east coasters and went today. What a disappointment!! First timers are going to wonder what all the fuss is about . The burgers were lacking flavor, not hot and you had to look for the onions - and as we all know that gives this little (but expensive) burger the flavor and steam needed to make that bun so special. Neither were there. The bun top actually made it a bit dry since there was NO ketchup and cold! As a local, I will buy the frozen ones and not make the trip to the strip for this $1.29 miss . At least when heated they possess the flavor we remember even adding your own ketchup and pickle"
jOTRB2LWSDTijelIKY2RgA,"Came here last week for lunch. Finally made my way here 11 years after the movie. I didn't have too much expectation coming here. Had the regular beef sliders, chicken sliders, and cheese fries. The beef I found was pretty thin, but the toppings and the fluffy bun def made it taste above average. The chicken lacked toppings and was a tad dry. The cheese fries are good, but you could probably make your own easily at home. Overall, it was a mediocre experience for me. At the end of the day, it's fast food. So if you just want something relatively quick and cheap, this could be one of your options."
HWyrbAXyFCzQlNP8_NlnMQ,"The only white castle burger I've ever had prior has been the microwaveable frozen kind. A last minute decision to eat something reasonably priced lead me here. So here's my verdict: 

Cheeseburger- 2.5 stars 
Jalapeño cheeseburger- 3.75 stars. The white cheese is a nice change of pace from American cheese, adds a slight kick and adds an extra oomph to the overall burger compared to the regular cheese. 
Fish burger- 3 stars 
Crinkle cut fries- 3 stars. Just average. 
Onion chips- 3.5 stars. Good breading, nicely fried. Have had better but not too shabby for fast food. 

7 burgers, one drink, and onion chips came out to about $19. 

I'll be back for the onion rings and the jalapeño cheeseburger."
sgzd9F0317i6pv0uN_9fMQ,"Overpriced and halfassed

I am a NJ native and have had white castle for over 15 years.  This place is like a cheap imitation while charging almost double for it.  

First issue is the fact they don't add ketchup like they do at all white castles.  I had to tear all of my burgers apart to add ketchup which being sliders was cumbersome.  Even the guy I complained to who is from NJ said "" we don't do that, even though all of the other ones do it"".

Second issue was the quality.  The burgers weren't fully cooked, since the patties are so thin, this is very hard to screw up.

Third issue was the fries.  They were much thinner and far less quantity than the normal white castles.

Fourth issue was the very loud intercom, they yell almost every 15 seconds your order numbers.  This interrupts the dining experience and hurt my ears.

If you want the real white castle experience I highly suggest you skip this horrible excuse for a white castle and go to an established one."
QO-ihFNkUhphPVWGuQQXjw,"I have only been here twice at this location. We don't live far but both times we have gone there, food was very good :-) Fast service!"
vAFBR0AAcXGY2xZcr98nfw,"I wish this place lived up to the hype. I mean Harold and kumar had a whole adventure trying to get to this place! Anyway, we came in at around 6pm on a Wednesday and was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a long line. We ordered sliders with the American cheese and jalapeño cheese, fries, chicken rings, onion chips, and a drink. We also got the brownie and cheesecake dipped in fudge for dessert. We wanted to try everything on the menu basically lol the food came out pretty fast. It really fell flat on the food. Everything was really bland. There's no seasoning whatsoever on anything. The sliders were kinda soggy. The onion chips had such a thick coating with no flavor. The best thing we had was probably the brownie for dessert lol it's cool to try if you're curious since it's quite famous. Just don't expect a lot so you won't get disappointed."
jIfFYL2NbnROQJ6b55dKEQ,"So we were vacationing in Vegas and got super excited when we saw a White Castle on the strip, living in the West Coast we've never tried it and heard how amazing these burgers are so we wanted to see what the whole fuzz was about.  Oh man we expected too much those burgers were so gross it tasted like something you can feed to a dog, after the first bite I wanted to puke.  It even got us sick ugh I seriously don't think it's real meat I don't know the quality was horrible. McDonald burgers even taste better,  better yet stick to In N Out , best burgers ever and taste fresh unlike here , NEVER AGAIN , SAVE YOUR MONEY PLZ"
p0aRZ-27_uncdcFYNKinXA,"If you never tried it, must experience it. Great little burgers that will fill you up. 10 should be enough for a person. Good place for late night in Vegas. Opens 24/7.  Line isnt so long. Worth to try and wait for. Great for hangovers after the club."
VadQuxkx2DbT3kY9rIewbw,"White Castle was in Las Vegas as a food truck during the Las Vegas Foodie Fest previous years and the line for it was un-fricken-believable. Reportedly, people waited long hours for the infamous tiny sliders. I didn't wait for it personally, but I did see the extreme amount of people in line as I was exploring other (and better) food options. And now it's here not as a mobile restaurant, but an actual restaurant, hidden away in the Casino Royale. 

To find it, you need to walk a little bit, so make time for that. I don't mind playing tourist in my own city every now and then, but lemme tell ya, for White Castle? Not worth it!

The little sliders are, at best, just cute. The meat was dry and it didn't help that the regular sliders were like 90% buns and meat. There were onions and pickles on it but it seemed like 2 little tiny pieces of diced onions, and a pickle the size of a dime. I prefer the cheese sliders over the regular ones.

About 5-6 sliders can fill me up really good on a hungry day, so order accordingly. The way they fill up the beer with the magnet is pretty cool! :) Oh, and perks, 10% off for locals with a local ID!

I'd say this place isn't really worth the hassle to get... maybe a good place to stop by when you're playing tourist in your own city, but that's about it."
sAiUJ4B8YGhuS4oT00Ynxg,"For a super busy fast food joint on the strip they are getting it done. Waited less than 5 minutes for my food, they clean off the tables as soon as anyone stands up. Ask for the dusseldorf mustard or you won't get it."

bJJuIFmT52A-Ye6kZ54I6g,"Growing up back east we would go to white castle and get the burgers by the dozen. Of course that was many years ago and you could get them for around 25 cents, that's really showing how long ago that was. So I was glad to see one open here on the strip. So I packed up the wife (who never had one) and off we went. After a short walk and a short line we ordered. Shocked by the prices, but everything costs more today. Told the wife how good these were while growing up. I guess all things change from what I remember. As soon as I pulled the burger from the package it seemed the burger was way thinner than I remembered and after the first bite I was disappointed on the taste. Guess this is off our list on coming back along with the ""shake shack"" also. How disappointed this was from the memories of my youth. Pay a little more and find one of the other burger places nearby so not to be disappointed."
RqUY5MgE9FnlcRyaU0Gq8g,"I have always wanted to try White Castle; I have only had the frozen burgers.  Needless to say when I saw a White Castle on the strip in Las Vegas I was ecstatic.  The line to order moved fast, the line to pick up food was super slow but who cares its White Castle.  The burgers are small and delicious, the bread was warm and soft.  It was the burger slider."
Vrm9mffNiLflnkY33ixRvg,"Harold and Kumar sure make it seem like this is the place to be. For many years, I have been wanting to try this hoping that I would be blown away from the taste. Since they do not have this chain down south, where I stay, I had not been able to taste it.  Until one day, I was driving by the vegas strip and noticed it tucked deep in the sidelines of the Casinos.  After some tricky parking, and a long trek I was finally at the register ordering the cheese slider meal.  At first glance, everything seemed good, heck it sure did make for a great instagram post, which is mandatory for me on all food I eat.  After the first bite, I was left unimpressed.  I would easily rank Fatburger and In and out above this chain and even Mcdonalds.  It was definitely great to finally try it but would not go out of my way to do it again."
zthpcSQxPti3iGEL70Gq1w,"When I was living in Vegas, they didn't have a White Castle yet. This one is fairly new. I wanna say maybe a year now? 

Anyways, if you're in Vegas, White Castle is a MUST if you're on the strip. Especially when you're drunk. Their burgers are like sliders, small but they're less than $2! 

They are delicious! 

They are located near Fat Tuesday and Harrah's hotel. 

If you aren't in any of the states that has a White Castle, Target sells frozen boxes of White Castle sliders. It won't be the same but it's close!"
HXFFSADKq3rU7UI1xDUWcQ,"Have been a fan of White Castle for years! Started when I was a child getting their burgers frozen from the supermarket. At that time I never knew it was a restaurant. Then the popularity from Harold & Kumar happened making want to always try a White Castle restaurant. I finally had my chance this summer in Las Vegas! I was actually feeling like a little kid again as we were on our way walking up the strip looking for this place! A special adventure! I was so happy to finally eat at a White Castle! To me, this was the first mini burger I have ever had, so it was unique. 

I ordered the 20 pack of sliders and 2 regular fries combo pack. $25.99 before tax. Sitting down and laying them all out for my girlfriend and I people thought it was all to myself since she was in the restroom. I laughed and said no, I could have eaten all of it, but not today :P The burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones, just a bit fresher. Not too surprising, would give them a 3 stars. But the extra star for me was the service and overall experience I got from finally eating at this place! Highly recommended for a quick burger bite! Would go back again next time I visit Vegas!"
y8_mzVHrTZaS65FKwItlSg,"This is a good place to come with friends. I was told to try these sliders by Chicago transplants in Las Vegas. I like the burgers, but, I am an In N' Out/ PDQ fan. The sliders are different, however, I have had tastier sliders in Phoenix and Oakland. They serve beer, so it's a nice break to the strip bars or ending the night with friends."
AKGZtil9ocIeGR-89nHF8A,This place was pretty good! Had never eaten there beforem the staff was efficent in how they made and delivered their food.
GRR3feJBrUOHdMOq9YK3kw,"OK, let's be honest here...if you like White Castle you like White Castle.  There is no in-between.  I grew up in the midwest, so I happen to love them!  So, I can't help it...  It is a true guilty pleasure.  They are simply little steamed cheeseburgers of joy.  Soft, fluffy and delicious!  I always just get the cheeseburger sliders.   The line here in Vegas can move slow if there are a crowd of people, but the burgers are as good as any White Castle in Chicago.  If you crave...you crave...and this location delivers!"
A9bb4tYbnlilkQCsB05sPg,"I wanted to try this place because I heard from people that it was a good fast food joint.

To start off, their location is quite terrible. Unless you are walking on the strip, it takes quite an effort to get to the restaurant since you have to go through people and traffic, park at a casino, then walk down the strip to eat here. 

When it comes to waiting, the time you wait in line to order is a lot longer than the time to get your food. My friend and I ordered #9, 3 cake on a stick, chicken rings, and onion chips. Literally, right after we ordered it took about 30 seconds for us to get all of our food. 

The quality of the food is disappointing and it might be because of how busy they are. The sliders weren't anything great and their fries are not crispy at all. Their chicken rings didn't have much flavor in them either. However, their onion chips and cheesecake on a stick were amazing.

Their service is a lot better than I assumed. The worker who took my order was extremely kind, patient, and helpful. Everyone looks like they're trying their best to work as quickly as possible to meet every customer's needs.

To be honest, White Castle is okay but it just wasn't for me. The food isn't worth the wait like people think it'd be."
QAdukiRRCIYNkLY2X4fGCw,"When the frozen burgers are better than the restaurant burgers, you have a big problem. Just. No. I'm sure the Midwest locations might be slightly better."
Uu9KkHvojcmEIvI1Ttukqw,Ever since I went to White Castle when I visited back east as a teenager I've always wanted to go back because I really enjoyed theirs food. Circumstances be as they may I've never been back east but low and behold they're here in Vegas which is way closer to California. Many people have ranted and raved about shake shack and after trying their much over hyped food my money is and will always be on White Castle. Better service and Better food. It's the way I remember it so many years ago.
-ewFqwdR5fQw7ffQfLAo9w,When I have been in the past it was always amazing but this time it sucked.  They were not hot they were just warm and me and my friend did not feel well after eating there
-PkAOH3-X0ulik2VYyThSQ,"White castle is like bubba gump, famous from a movie. The only difference that white castle was in existence before the movie came out.  We went to Vegas and slave girl has never been to white castle yet, so for love, I went to another bad place to eat. 

The service was actually good. The lady at the counter was super friendly and very pleasant. Ordering was easy and fast. Good job. We ordered a 10 pack burger with 6 pc chicken ring and loaded fries. 

Now on with the food. White castle burgers are cheap but small. The burger patty was thinner than a sausage patty but flavorful. However, the flavor was not the typical burger flavor and I wasn't a fan of that taste. The chicken ring was nuggets smashed with a hole in the middle. Dry and nasty. Our friend ordered this onion thing but it was also dry with almost no trace of onion. 

The only thing that was decent was the loaded fries. I think we just liked bacon. 

All and all, you gotta wonder why eating White Castle in Vegas when we were surrounded with some of the best restaurants in the country. Slave girl said never again, lol."
gZRnquooKhRqPQBziEZAFg,"We went here just because of the Harold and Kumar movie. Not worth the hype. The service was okay, but for the price definitely go somewhere else."
uusmDouBCt8vZr1BiAKWzA,"Smaller menu and way overpriced compared to other white castles. If this was regular priced i would give it 3 or 4 stars because it is in par with most on the east coast but for almost $20 a person, no big red, and a really long line. I can only give it 2 stars but would doubt i would be back."
UT369fBkL-xGFpW4t27xEQ,"The food was good as expected. However, the service was horrible. Shanon was there to give us our food but when we asked for sauces she was very disrespectful. We ordered a combo for 4 but she did not provide enough sauces for us. Also her side comments were very unfriendly when I pointed at the sauces she threatened that she would ""slap my hand"". I would say she is unfit for that position and she should just stay at the back of the house away from customers with that kind of attitude."
dHiBTaU0DxFJ34kRHMI15g,"Okay, don't expect any good quality food here.

The White Castle sliders in the frozen section in most grocery stores tastes almost EXACTLY like the sliders you will get here, except here, it's freshly cooked and not soggy! 

You basically come here just cuz you can say you went to White Castle (without going to the East Coast). 

The perfect snack after a day of drinking lol!"
Esla6J0YJI1-Kvu_1ZN1ug,"I had to give them a 4 stars for not putting mustard and catchup on the burgers,  but it was clean, the staff was really friendly, and the wait wasn't terrible."
zZLutWTNw8SFsncf41EgpA,"I won't rate based on long lines and wait times. You obviously see how long the line is and should be able to judge that that wait will be lengthy. You get in line of your own free will, if you don't want to wait then go elsewhere. I also will not rate based on comparisons to other fast food empires (in-n-out, shake shack, McDonald's, etc).  What I am basing my rating in is the food. Let me be completely clear here...if you have ever had the frozen, microwaveable grocery store White Castle sliders then be advised that it is EXACTLY the same as what you will get here. Kudos (I guess) to whoever produces the frozen versions available at the grocery stores because they have 100% matched the taste, consistency, texture and quality of the famous White Castle slider. I wouldn't waste my money on that stuff at the market so I certainly would not ever walk in to another White Castle brick & mortar restaurant location. Sorry but there are WAY too many quality options in town to even consider wasting my time, money, or tastebuds on White Castle."
S6mWdNjQuagpRGOKdd6d-w,So our 1st time @ a real White Castle. ..not at the frozen isle....not bad bout the same tho....they had beer on tap a plus !  Hmm just not that exciting.....very pricey but it is Las Vegas. ...sure I'd go back if I was real hungry. ..
8DAvcAu7VdDLvbpkw8uIxw,"So worth it. Probably not for everyone's taste though. (4 of the 5 of us loved it. One whined cause onions. *rolls eyes* kids.)

My only problem with it is the location. Here I was hoping it would be in like Luxor or maybe even Excalibur (far better placement). As a non-smoker with severe asthma, I was coughing my lungs out to get to it through the casino, and continued to cough while I tried to eat. Next time I'll send someone in to buy, and we'll leave after. -_-"
ATHdKAAbnUW2FD31CIndrw,"Update: apparently they are supposed to be soggy, so if you like soggy buns then this is the place for you."
BTgbsaqtKt2CUdmq2hj3kQ,"Food 10/10 we bought a box of frozen White Castle cheese burger and loved it. The real store is way better 

Ambience 6/10 it's on the Main Street of LV, not great but understandable 

Service 7/10

We cannot wait to come back again"
VFlWeRb8GGsTOyzaXOS_uQ,I had high hopes for this place.  First off they had my order wrong the lady working the cash register was rude and the food was terrible. The french fries were the only thing that I liked.  The burgers were just plain gross. For my first ever visit I had a terrible experience I won't be coming back to this place ever.
yF0tom1xKa0i-mJojCJU3Q,"A White Castle on the west side of the country!  Being from California, I'm surprised they have invade this state yet.  

Tried the Las Vegas location on a short trip recently.  It's a bit tough to get to.  I parked at the Venetian and took the long walk all the way to the strip to get to the restaurant.  It's not necessarily big but there should be enough tables to accommodate who's in line.

If you've had White Castle before, I always say its good if its late night eats or if you're pretty drunk, or both.  Other than that, the food isn't exceptionally great.  In fact, it's actually a bit on the expensive side.  A four slider meal with a handful of crinkly fries and a coke goes for about $10 after tax.  Not really cheap.  You actually might still be hungry after that.  I don't hate it but if it was a few bucks cheaper, I think it would be a better value for your buck."
G_YnuxiyvRk5MYDdaZp5hA,The line moved pretty fast. I was in and out with my food within an hour and half. The food was amazing!! Totally worth the wait! Yes the prices were higher as if you were to go back to the mid west. However you have to take into count that. Mid west is cheaper. This is Las Vegas. And also it's the strip everything on the strip is priced higher. So can't complain. Def worth waiting in line for!!
X0CGvIoOtz2lAodzHE920g,"Being from the Midwest I've had plenty of experience with White Castles so I was excited when one was opening here in Vegas. The first time I went there was good. I know it's on the Strip and I expected it to be packed so that wasn't a problem. 
I went here a second time and this is why I won't ever be back. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I finally ordered a dozen burgers to go. I don't care for onions so I ordered those burgers without them and the lady repeated that. I waited several more minutes for them to come out--my mistake was not checking them in the restaurant. I drove all the way home only to find out these burgers had been completely caked in onions. After scraping off a massive amount of onions, reheating the burgers and having my meal I decided to call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake. I was surprised when no one answered. I tried a few more times. Nothing. The next day I tried calling and still nothing. So I left a voicemail with my contact information. I waited a few days and received no type of reply back. At this point I gave up. If they can't even reply to a customer then they don't deserve my business. White Castle can be good but this location has a big ego being the only one in Vegas. If you do encounter a problem you will have to personally go in and inquire about it. No one cares enough to call back. Just a forewarning."
JuXfEPVfuKTcp4dimmF_4Q,"I am from the Chicagoland area so I have been eagerly awaiting a WC to come to my area. 
Only gave a-ok due to two things... 1) The fries were almost hot but considering there was a line to order and pick up, can't figure out why the fries would not be cooked properly and served hot. 2) Parking..... Good luck if you don't know the area, OR park at Venetian and walk down to the Strip.
The burgers were awesome! 
Didn't like that you could only order burgers in a combo fashion. Prices are high!! But I suppose that is to be expected on the Strip.
Hate to say it, and I prefer In-n-Out.........."
qtMk5fQFvH17B0MBsUHheQ,"It was exactly as how I expected it to be. Sliders were just like the frozen ones I buy at the grocery store. People hype up this place too much and I blame Harold and Kumar for that. Food here is just like the food at the White Castle in Chicago. 

Beef patties are thin, just like the frozen ones. Slider is small, exact size like the frozen one. Service here is ok, just like how it is at with any other fast food chain. They do however, have other options to choose from other than cheese sliders and the original sliders. Line is long but moves quickly and food comes out quickly. Just like any other fast food joint. 

Don't come here and expect it to be a 4 star restaurant. It's just another 3 star fast food place."
_XReAbTvW2oF7Td2WYZtyQ,"I would give this place a MINUS one star if was possibly. Just another tourist trap on vegas strip. Over priced junk food. Meat that tastes like wet carboard, bland fries, NOTHING special about this place.

If this is one of the best burger restaurant chains in the east coast, and people like this crap, i would call them: ""IGNORANTS""

Another McDonald's dollar menu contestan that lose the battle......(and that's sad !!)"
IcnLlzBtC1rVndeSBJG-AQ,"What kind of ghetto operation is this?  Big sign saying open 24/7, but when I get off at 5am they are closed from 5 to 8am. What a joke. I am thoroughly pissed. You are false advertising. F-/&$k you White Castle!!!!!"
j6qvz5Lc0oCRNLBTHr9WbA,Meh.  It tastes like the ones you buy in the frozen aisle and is nothing special.  Harold and Kumar what were you thinking... oh right...
BJyMV2-3ckFAPHtCx2aukg,"This is nice as a quick little snack. If there isn't a line, it's nice to pick up just a couple little sliders.

This last visit we tried to make it a meal, and ordered one of the big combo meals, but it's just too much fast food for me.

I guess I just much prefer a real burger with all of the vegetables."
WfpAJWXGRxAnB21U5M6kFw,"after years and years of making microwavable white castle burgers, my drunken self brought my drunken group here after too many Fat Tuesdays! 

i ordered 4 of the cheeseburgers and my god these are heavenly! 
the right amount of grease from the grill, nice amount of onions, a slab of cheese, a toasty bun to soak up the flavors, the pickles however i was not a fan of and actually was not aware that they were on the burgers but it was not a big downer to the burgers!

one of my friends ordered the chicken rings and these were basically like chicken nuggets but better! 

it isn't the cheapest but also not THAT expensive, i think my four burgers came to about $8? 
 
i would love to stop by again for a snack or quick bite next time in Vegas!"
cBd-_3u4NOFd0ldDdasVdA,"More hype than anything.  I've had my share of burgers including WC in NYC and they did not bring their A-game to LV.

Long lines, greasy burgers, no seating, and wafer thin patties for a premium price.  Also, if you've had WC on the Easy Coast, you'll be disappointed to find that they only sell the regular or cheese burgers and you can't buy them individually.   Only in meals.  

I was pretty hungry the day I went, and didn't even eat all of my burgers. And it wasn't because I was full. Nuff said."
OeLetYeTuSrDEp8d12yhrQ,"Overhyped! I don't get why people are so crazy about this place 

Had this three times over my last Vegas trip but only because it was close to the palazzo and conveniently open 24hours so we could grab some grub after the club. It was okay the first time because I was drunk but the second night I was sober and it's really just mediocre. Everyone else devoured the sliders but I was far too sober to be enjoying them. Tastes like something I could've heated up from my freezer. 

Pack of 10 costs about $11 and $3 extra if you want to add cheese
But there's really nothing special or note worthy about the food. 
It's just convenient and cheap considering it's Vegas

Might come back but only if I have mad drunchies next time I'm in Vegas"
k_v3nKwGGG6h9-C--SRoyA,"Ok ok ...so you know how I was major hating on White Castle in my first review...well, I'll give it 3 stars this time around!

Came here on Fat Tuesday after some drinks at The Linq. Ordered the 10 mini burgs with cheese, large fries, cheesecake, and cheese sticks.

It was cool. I mean, for $20 or so, it was cool.

Burgers were hot, fresh, bite sized. 
Cheesecake was REALLY small for being a cheesecake (on a stick!).

I think the plus was the funny cashiers and the 10% OFF FOR LOCALS!!!!!!!!"
1G53stMAUYkDfSFyufbmzw,"I am from the East and have eaten white castles for a long time.  I love them and couldn't wait for them to get here I went the opening day.  i was not happy with the price.  They should be ashamed for charging people so much.  I brought them the first day and will not come back.  $8.99 for 4-cheeseburgers, fires, and soda are you people crazy.  My 11 yr old grand daughter can eat that and more because the burgers are so small. .I paid $15 plus some change for that combo plus 4-burgers.  That was my usual order after the club in Chicago and Minneapolis.  It  cost me $6 plus some change for the same order the last time I had them in Minneapolis.  I have not lived here that long so I have recently had white castles.  Just because it is on the strip that should not make such a big difference.  That is just pure greed!!!  if they open a store off the strip and the prices are within reason I would patronize that store but not on the strip ever again.  It is so sad that companies are so greedy, you people make enough profits give us a break.  This is why I am only giving one star and I hope others follow suit."
gotGntGUUuec3_RLkllRug,Didn't wait in line but their sliders are blah. Honestly they have so much hype surrounding this place which is good for them but their sliders could use some magic touch to it. Maybe I gotta eat this shit stoned but yo it is not worth waiting in line. Another overhyped east coast - mid-west chain that thinks they can fuck with the west coast powerhouse In-N-Out. Unfortunately they got KTFO...
N5QdUMI74ooWloFND-CYeQ,"I had my first experience with the White Castle (WC) food truck at the Great American Foodie Fest held in San Diego. I always heard of the business--known for their sliders--and was always interested in tasting one of their products. I guess I just assumed that WC was like the McDonald's of the East Coast, and I wanted to see what it was about those sliders that made them so great (especially after seeing the White Castle excerpt from ""Harold and Kumar"").
 
There were pre-organized queues and a HUGE WC tent, so I'm sure the vendor expected mile-long lines. However, when we went on the first night the foodie fair was open, there was NO line; only a few people were in front of us so we didn't have to wait long to order and get our grub.
 
Final verdict: After all that hype, I think I was slightly underwhelmed by those sliders. Maybe it's just because I was different from what I was expecting. Was I glad I tried them? Yes, definitely. Would I crave them late at night? Not so much ... if I were craving fast food late at night, I would probably go for Five Guys fries (soooo addictive) or anything from Del Taco or Chick-Fil-A.
 
But here's what my friend and I got, as well as what I would try next time if I ever visited a WC again:
 
""Cheese Sliders"": These sliders vary slightly from the ""Original"" because they include a slide of American cheese. I need cheese in my burgers ... since I take out the tomatoes and pickles, I can't really just have a slider with the burger alone. My friend and I got 2 for $3 (at least these buggers were cheap), and we saw them being mass produced--in that the thin patties were on the grill in multiples and the workers were putting everything together in true assembly-line fashion. The bun was soft and tasted fresh, which was a plus, but the patty--is that what you even call it?--was super thin ... so thin that I could hardly even taste it. It reminded me of a super thin slice of Spam. I liked the fact that the slider was really light--didn't feel heavy and bloated after eating it--but it definitely needed that cheese. I guess I was expecting the slider to be addicting/have some kind of addictive taste since it got so much hype, but that factor was lacking for me. I'm glad for the experience, but I would probably order something different next time. (Seriously, I don't know how people order packs and packs of these).
 
""Bacon & Cheddar Grilled Chicken"": I would actually be interested in trying this slider because it has more elements that I like. This medley features savory grilled chicken with a zesty cheddar-cheese sauce and smoky-bacon crumbles. I do like cheese and bacon, so maybe this slider will be slightly more tasty that the ""Cheese Slider"" that I had.
 
""Western BBQ Grilled Chicken"": I love BBQ flavors so this slider sounds like it's right up my alley. It features a savory, grilled chicken slider topped with smoky BBQ sauce and crispy onion rings. I do like BBQ-inspired sandwiches, so I'm down to try this slider one day.
 
""Fish Sliders"": I've had fish sliders before that I really liked, so I'm willing to give the WC version a go. It features two fish sliders made with Alaska Pollock and topped with American cheese. You can even upgrade to a combo and add small fries and a soft drink. I'm not the hugest fan of soft drinks, but I would want to add fries to my order ... this is sort of like fish 'n chips, after all, but in slider form.
 
""Loaded Fries"": I'm a huge fan of loaded fries, and since the WC version features fries topped with creamy ranch dressing and hickory-smoked bacon crumbles, I'd definitely want to order them some day.
 
""Brownie on a Stick"": This dessert sounds really cute and seems to be a great mini indulgence. This treat on a stick features a chocolate brownie dipped in a rich, fudge coating. Brownies are one of my favorite snacks, and everything just tastes better when it's presented in a fun form ... so if I'm craving something sweet after my WC meal, I would go for this.
 
""Cheesecake on a Stick"": Like its brownie counterpart, this cheesecake piece is bound to be the best little indulgence after a fast food meal. It's made with light and creamy cheesecake and dipped in a rich, fudge coating. I'm so down to try this chocolate covered cheesecake (both of these dipped dessert options were not available at the truck, so maybe I have to visit an actual WC restaurant to get it ...)
 
""Bacon, Egg & Cheese Slider"": This breakfast slider sounds like one of the best ones on the WC menu. It includes freshly cracked, loosely scrambled eggs topped with American cheese and crisp, hickory-smoked bacon on a steamed signature bun. I'm a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, so I would be willing to try this breakfast slider if I came to WC when the breakfast menu's being featured."
rP7RK5kyu_kaK4N_YIvP_g,"Juste bon pour se caller

Point positif : pas cher du tout"
XBAOIjGY9KYBxqU5VzzlpQ,"It's possible that I'm just an easy sell when it comes to nostalgic food items, but I've always enjoyed their sliders ever since I knew how to use a microwave, so despite the fact that they're greasy and incredibly junky, I still love em!

They taste exactly like the ones you find at the frozen section of your local grocery store/7-11 (after they've been defrosted/heated, of course).... even though they're supposed to be *somewhat* more fresh when prepared right away. Really, it's not any different, so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas, unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings, fries, etc.

If you're planning a visit anyway, the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you, but I always felt awkward biting into an onion ""ring"". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York, and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu.

The mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons, so if you and I share that intense disgust for it, stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh! 

I'm not an active environmentalist, but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter, so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate, and typical wrappers would've squashed them."
wcLlGLMwdVerQzZ6YRsl9A,"Ate at the new White Castle today because there has been so much buzz around Vegas.   I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The food is better than McDonalds but I've had better sliders at BJ's.   Compared to In-n-Out or Five Guys, this place is waaaay down on the list of best burger joints. All you east-coasters that rave about White Castle - maybe you need to eat at a west-coast joint..."
jXoaf0pl16jreQ7Iau20WA,Good burgers.  Burgers taste a little better than the frozen packs I buy at the store.  The fries are good.  I will be back.
gFhcaowcadwKLEXSESG8Kw,White Castles are my favorite. They started in Wichita but Kansas has no White Castles. Go figure. Las Vegas White Castle opened in January. Order the family pack with 10 or 20. Fries or onion petals atr a must. Cheesecake on a stick is great
vrNNSPUXX1OCTqShfjImvw,"I was surprised to find that this East Coast chain had found its way to the Las Vegas Strip. So I figured, let's find out what Harold and Kumar made such a fuss about. At first I wasn't that impressed. BUT, for some strange reason, I kept finding myself coming back every night to soak up the day and night of drinking. That smell of grilled onions had such an aroma that I couldn't stay away. I know it isn't the highest quality or best burger, but it got the job done. I found myself ordering the 4 burger meal. They even sell a ""Sack"" or case of burgers (up to 100) AND they serve beer here. Great Combo. I will be back WC. Oh yes, I will be back."
3vbK0S0PmDnZWgiicZFTsw,"Well, my experience at White Castle Las Vegas was consistent with a lot of others: just short of bad. 

We stopped by midday and ordered one of the slider meals, adding mozzarella sticks to it. In the long wait for our food, I noticed that every person working behind the counter looked miserable. Everyone. 

The food that comes out of this kitchen (despite its fast food quality) does not equate to the product sold elsewhere. Add to this the fact that prices are marked up to ""Strip value.""

Come to the Casino Royale to grab a few cheap beers at the bar adjacent to this place, but don't feel bad if you decide to skip White Castle."
GVy7mUG2uOXeByID6iyBZQ,"Rumors raved about White Castle and their arrival here in Vegas. I gave into the flock and went to try it out.

I hate myself for not checking yelp first.

I have no clue why anyone would waste a moment on this food chain. The line was incredibly long, they required three guards to monitor. Three. I expected a drunken brawl to pop up with this level of security. I ordered a 10 slider pack, 2 fries, 1 onion chips, and 2 drinks for $26.

There were no seats so we had to snatch a table at the Subway nearby. The wait was long but the word ""crave"" was scattered all over the walls so I thought that is had to be worth the wait. Welp, I was wrong.

I wasn't surprised by the size of the slider, they are meant to be tiny and cute, but I've seen cheese slices thicker than these meat patties. And overall it was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. Crinkle cut fries should have that extra crunch but these were limp and bland as well. Everyone knows to salt the fries straight out of the fryer, except these guys. I sampled a chicken ring from a friend. It's cute but nothing special. My friend did find a little bone in one of his rings. At least we know it's real chicken. The only star of the whole meal were the onion chips.

I loved the assembly line but I was disappointed that all of that hard work for food that tasted microwaved.

Oh, and did I mention that this morning I woke up to the sound of my boyfriend hurling his heart out? Keep in mind that we were sober all night. Definitely not worth the trip."
JMJsxMDXlnrgOTdULsya9g,"I don't know what the heck Harold and Kumar were on when they got white castle but boy do I wish I had some of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgiiS1fjoUY

So growing up, I've had White Castle burgers from the frozen aisles and I loved it. However, after watching Harold and Kumar, I've always wanted to try White Castle. Luckily, they finally opened one up in Vegas in Casino Royale and I just had to give it a try. Just walking in, there isn't much separating white castle from every other fast food joint.

I ordered 4 cheese burger sliders with some fries for around $8. Boy, did this place suck. Honestly, minus the cool boxes the sliders are in, the cheese burgers here taste the same as the burgers I microwave. Same goes for the fries. Just salty empty carbs... 

Overall, this place disappointed me. Next time, I'll just buyer the microwaveable ones and just eat those or I can go to the millions of better burger joints in the area."
5yP0EY0K6A4JJygfM_BjKw,"I guess I'm like the other hundreds of customers, that ignored the two stars and came to check out White Castle for myself. I have been wanting to try this place for years, so glad when I finally see it in Vegas. Do not come here expecting to have a burger your way with 86 options to choose from, you can venture down the strip if you want to spend 40 bucks on a gourmet burger. This place is serious business here, they have A LOT of employees working in assembly lines preparing burgers, refilling soda machines, stocking up on ketchup, cleaning up as soon as a vacant seat is available, calling out numbers with video screen assistance like the DMV, organized chaos at its finest. The line stayed long, it moved quickly, and the staff was great. I got the cheese sliders, and being a cheese lover I do not think I would enjoy burger as much without it. The fries were mediocre, but probably taste better with toppings. Overall this is a great late night munchies spot and I am sure to return."
MGH37BQz4VasqgxxTymYLg,"I don't know what to think other than I am getting old.

You either love this place or hate it. Yet I'm both.

I love it while eating it but hate it while I burp up onions all afternoon.

I like White Castle's frozen burgers back home but I love the fresh burgers on the Strip. The pickle is an extra special surprise that is not on the frozen burgers.

This may have been the last time I enjoy these burgers. I've loved them all my life but the onion burps are just too much!

(It's really bad when you know your own breath stinks!)"
W13afG7xixnnesq1MkkgAQ,"White Castle Burgers has finally decided to bring their iconic sliders to the West Coast! And Las Vegas is a great place to test the waters. Hopefully with the successes and buzz the Las Vegas store is gettin. There will be more stores opening soon! In the meantime, the one in LV on the strip across from the Mirage Casino resort will do, eventhough they charge an arm n a leg for a tiny burger! I remember it used to only cost 25 cents a slider in the NYC area."
pTXgR5vdgNPoob3tKYm6PA,"After hearing about White Castle for ages, I finally found myself near one in Vegas so my wife and I decided to give it a try. My fist impression is that it is a bit strange, they have a very precise process of cooking onions, burgers and buns, and it all appears very methodical. They cook on these little square griddle inserts in the counters and there are multiple little stations. 
Not sure where their beef comes from, but it does look a bit unappetizing when they are laying it out in the onions, at first I thought they were putting on some sort of red square rubber spacers with holes in them so they can steam the buns with the onion aroma, but nope, those square red Lego looking things are actually the patties. 
I was aware that they only offer little sliders, but I was not aware that the little sliders cost the same as a full sized burger elsewhere (1 single plain slider with nothing on it costs $1.35), they have to have huge margins here as you get basically a meatball on a roll for the price of a Big Mac. (Not that I condone eating Big Macs)
We ordered the meal that came with 4 sliders (with cheese) and some fries, and also ordered 2 of their chicken ring sliders. The chicken ones were actually pretty tasty, tasted very similar to burger kings chicken sandwiches, the sort of over processed ground chicken variety. The sliders were fairly tasty and I did like the idea of eating the little thing, and though they are very basic they taste pretty good, as everything cooks in and with their caramelized onions. I did, however, need to dip the burger in ketchup to get a more deep flavor. I felt like they tasted sort of like a basic McDonald's Cheeseburger and an In-n-out ""Animal Style"" cheeseburger had a baby (so somewhere I between the quality of the 2 though much more on the McDonald's side).
The Fries were also pretty good, though nothing to write home about. They are the wavy variety and not over salted. 
Because the things were so small, I had the go back and order more food! This time I got 2 more chicken ring sliders and went for 2 double cheese sliders this time, which by the way are over $3 a piece! That's like the price of the ""six dollar burger"" at Carl's Jr, or the more expensive burgers at about every fast food chain, but again even the double burger is less substantial than a single ""$.99 cent menu"" burger elsewhere. 
All in all we ended up spending over $30!!! Just to get full here, that is a ton for a fast food place!
I really don't think I'll be back to a White Castle anytime soon, it's possible the craving could hit me when I see one because it is a unique taste, but even then, I'll likely just grab one slider to go and eat it on the way to wherever else I'm going to eat."
HXQsMpyw8kCFe38sYaJhNA,"I had White Castle once before in when I was visiting Chicago and I didn't get it then.  When my sister-in-law saw that there was a White Castle in Las Vegas, one of her vacation stops here had to be White Castle--something that she fondly remembers from her youth.  I am still firmly in the I don't get it column.

There were three of us and we ordered a 10 pack bag with three bottles of water.  The sliders come out to be just over a dollar each but they were missing something.  Even the devoted sister-in-law thought they were missing at the very least some salt (and she doesn't use salt very much).  

I was underwhelmed by the sliders.  The onion taste was about the best thing and it's really stretching it calling that little thin piece of beef a slider.  The thing is mostly bread.

Being in the Casino Royale doesn't make it an easily accessible place unless you're a tourist walking the Strip and decide to drop in.  We walked from the Venetian.

Again, I just don't get the cult following.  I'd rather spend a bit more and have something more substantial and a whole lot more flavorful!!"
NZVKejZURAY6de_2R0e-eQ,"First off, this place is white castle and is definitely not in the same leagues as bachi or even in n out for that matter.  Essentially the competitors to this restaurant are establishments like mcdonalds and wendys but I would much rather eat there than here.

1. OVERPRICED! you get the 6 slider meal and i think it comes out to $12? WTF go to glaziers and get the 6 cheese for $4 guys.

2. It tastes exactly like the kinds you buy frozen.  There literally was no difference at all in terms of taste.

3. Don't plan to go to hot yoga after because you will get bad gas. seriously... big mistake

Overall: It's really overpriced and the taste is comparable to the ones you can buy frozen but I will say that they do not taste all that bad."
J2flqJShtx3YIeI2fe_MHg,"""It taste so good when it hits the lips!""

This is a Midwestern girls dream come true to the Las Vegas desert. The line wasn't too long. Came here at midnight on a Saturday after a concert. It's consistent taste to any other east coast location I have ever eaten at. Glad they made their way out here. It really seems to be a good location too. 

I will probably be back at some point. Good things come in small packages."
Tearl5lYxYyqkGW1PVa4bg,"I've watched the movie White Castle and they make White Castle taste like the best burgers ever, what a deception...yeah I know it's a movie, they marketed it very very well.

The burgers were eh, wouldn't recommend, there are plenty of other places to eat in Vegas. The only good thing is that it's cheap..."
2YRY_SeN6QqbRO30r2y3vw,Shaylene gives amazing customer service and I didn't have a single problem even on their busiest days
MqdlhZVQMH1z41UnUwfg6Q,"The movie ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better."
czFCVgxVC-1LF-ko33UsTQ,"While in town visiting Vegas, I had to stop by to taste a fresh White Castle slider. When you go to their site it will list numerous of locations near me, but that is because they sell the frozen sliders. There are no White Castle locations near me so I had to try one.

As soon as I got there, there was plenty of seats and no line. It was in the afternoon when I got there. I was surprised to see they had beer there. That's cool! Beer and sliders. Great! I ordered my food and it came out quickly. Woohoo! I'm glad I came at the time I did since the place got busy as I was leaving.

I went with the cheese sliders and fries. The sliders were warm and tasty. They were so good. The bread was soft and the patty was tasty. I wasn't expecting crinkle fries for the fries. They were ok. This is a place you should try at least one."
Dw92S4DbupoPfc1T7gWkiQ,"This is essentially microwave food. I got chicken rings and fries, my husband got sliders. Everything tasted like it came from a box. Actually...I may have had frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets that were better than what I had at White Castle. I see why Harold and Kumar went after getting stoned--you would have to be under the influence of something to enjoy your meal.

Plus, everything was really pricy. We paid $17 for microwave food. Never again!"
Eos4VsqQeiO6fMf4MYVCFQ,"I grew up treasuring White Castle in Detroit in lines before Tiger games... Ooh...the thought of those sliders!!!

But this location is not your typical White Castle-- it is ""on fleek"" lol. Clean and shiny, interestingly located in a casino but reached from the street. 

We grabbed a sack with cheese-- fries and drinks. Sliders very good.. Better beverage selection would be a plus. 

Customer service... Let's just say we think no one there wants to be there. At least they didn't last night. 

Overall, a worthy stop for the White Castle experience. Would rate Detroit #1, Vegas #2 and New York (Brooklyn #3)"
-s_VqNjhapQvsRH3VwSl0g,"The movie was awesome, unfortunately can't say the same for the actual restaurant. I went to this specific White Castle during a Vegas weekend. I was expecting delicious small burger sliders with a side of fries for the amount of money I paid. It was horrible. And I don't blame any staff, this iPad to do with the quality of the burger. They basically tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you get at a local food market. Very disappointing. I couldn't even finish the small lil burgers. Would never recommend this franchise to anyone until they find a better supplier for their patties. And stop using microwave food. The fries were ok. The instructions say to ""put mustard on this review"" (and I wish I woulda put some
On that horrible burger) but I don't wanna sound like I'm trashing this franchise blatantly, I'm sure there's a few that will appreciate the quality of these small burgers. Good luck White Castle! Hope you get better, being this is our first west coast franchise.  

Ps: don't let the movie fool you!"
Hn4ZUnRsCmLOEm-j8gNw8A,"No wonder this place was featured in Harold and Kumar. You would need to be drunk or stoned to enjoy White Castle.

I was so excited to try this because relatives on the east coast love White Castle. Plus Harold and Kumar made this place seem like some sort of burger godsend. 

What a load of crap. Crappy bread, patties, and fries. At least they did the job and the fries weren't too salty.

But this is mediocre. In-N-Out is better."
4KctWubV7oqLCfyTnjfRvg,"Stumbled upon this place while walking the Strip and I just had to try it just because. I only ordered a Cheddar Fries and 1 Burger. I am glad that's all I ordered because it did not taste good at all. First off, the service is cap. They didn't really care about you. The cheddar fries was nothing exciting, it had stale fries. The burger is just nasty! It's soggy with no flavor. Maybe if you are drunk and hungry you can eat here but other than that, I would pass."
u2ZNACiOMC406BSixKGMYg,"It's White Castle.. It's late night munchies.Grab a bag or box of burgers get a milkshake. The power is bulk burgers, you are supposed to buy a bunch of them.

Not as good as a $10 burger? Yeah no kidding, Its a buck. 

I personally hold the pickle on the cheeseburger.

The staff is great, and the lineup seems long but it does move along at a fair clip.

Now open one in LA guys..."
tP4EwK1kDxbI27syBkk-Yw,"The hype with this one was strong. 
What with the constant talk on local news stations, blogs, websites how could you not feel the pressure as a lover of food in Las Vegas? We were not immune to the build-up and thus had to see what we were missing all these years. 
We visited on a Saturday, early evening/late afternoon timeframe. The place was busy, but that was no surprise with the aforementioned popularity still booming. The line was relatively long but moved at a decent rate. They do well to get you through and on your way. We waited about 15-20 minutes in line. The menu is simpler than most fast food type joints with limited offerings. Think somewhere between In n Out and Chil Fil A. I appreciate this; makes it easier for someone like me who wants to get right to the ""bread and butter"" if you will and skip over their second rate items. The sliders were much smaller than we expected; again we've never had even the frozen grocer variety so expectations were only speculative. It reminded me of a plain McDonalds burger with the small chopped onions being one of the only things on the burgers other than the meat. The fries were nothing special. Not great but also without any major flaw. Straightforward French fries. Our meal was over in less than 10 min and we left feeling quite disappointed, and overall confused about the hype. 
Guess it's just one of those things that you either get or you don't. 
And I don't."
xONZEbEbkzDjYOy9AmRZdA,Leave it to Las Vegas to ruin a Midwest gem. I was looking forward to White Castle being here but it is definitely not the same. I expected there to be a wait so I won't complain about the 1 hour and a half that I stood in line but I will complain that the line is like General admission for the club. I don't think they thought thoroughly about having a line outside on a busy strip sidewalk. Also I wasn't that far back in the line so I thought once I got into the building I would be minutes from ordering. Okay so the food; when I received my burgers they were lukewarm after coming fresh off of a grill! I also ordered chicken rings and they didn't have honey mustard! Dont even get me started on the employees! They need to bring some people from the MIDWEST to train these people. For those who have not had White Castle before this is not what all of us Midwest folks were excited about! It wasn't nearly the experience from back home! I agree with those that said you can go to the frozen section for what they are serving up here. Also they need to figure out how to get one off of the strip and with a drive-thru and breakfast. I will not be returning to this location.
u2AevBLIRg6NVIA6r-ty_w,Moved from the Midwest to Southern CA so this White Castles on the strip is the closest to me. Tastes good just like it does back home.
EXGH1iap71ondI-dNyrFHg,"This was our family's Christmas Day Lunch/Dinner (depending on what time you eat lunch/dinner). Seeing as my wife and I both love White Castle and there is not one no where near where we stay, this one was GREAT."
Wbs5xbCu8H3LsHZ0iwSdgg,"Finally, I finally went to the restaurant that Harold and Kumar having to go through numerous of obstacles to just eat there. But luckily I didn't need to go through the Obstacles Harold and Kumar needs to go through lol. But I did get there at 3 am and the there's still like a 20 mins wait pretty impressive in my Opinion. Well I think the white castle slider was alrite, nothing special and crazy about it their fish white castle was pretty good I have to say. But honestly, I rather have a Mcdonald burger or an In N out burger than the White Castle with the fact that their price are pretty similar."
K7avooSL44yrdBm_rPq9zg,"Nasty!!!  Our first experience here was when they first opened...its was good! Food was good, customer service was good. This time its completely different. Burns gross fries, horrible nasty ""customer"" service, sent the fries back to only get back-talk from one of the employees!!
Who does that!!! I'm guessing poor management is to blame? I'm not sure. The only thing good was the sliders!"
jzmxTup3fKJIGkFM2P-G1g,"Came here for the first time with my husband to see what all the hype was about. It was disgusting. I took 1 bite and was done. My husband forced himself to finish 2 sliders. We had stomachs afterwards. They tasted not fresh and maybe even frozen. Buns were soggy and meat slices are super thin. I got cheese fries and they were ok, nothing special. Only good thing we experienced was great customer service from the cashier. I wish I would've caught her name, but she was the only good thing that came off that place. Save your money and go elsewhere."
LhdkkLOlpztP3A4bziTsoQ,Burgers were good first time eating here heard a lot about it wanted to try it out taste was good on the sliders fries were alright will be bringing my girl and the kids
vkfEZIYZJaK_UQyZCpB-nQ,"Yes I know.  One minute I can go from a gourmet Gordon Ramsay BurGR to straight ghetto White Castle belly bombers in an instant, haha!  What can I say!  Well I can say, ""If you didn't grow up with White Castle, then you'll probably NEVER understand the sensation of biting into one of these heavenly sliders!""  Just keep in mind, they're NO comparison to a normal burger like In-n-Out.  So believe me, I'm McLovin' all the negative reviews.

Yes they're cute tiny little burgers and can be eaten in four bites.  But that soft steamy bun with a little bit of chopped onions, pickles, and melted cheese (or without) are just the best!  Not as healthy as a four start chain Habit Burger, or as beefy as Five Guys, but more of an ""if I had a fast food burger choice"" of a burger chain;  I'd choose the Dub C!  I mean, they made a movie out of it!  Plus I grew up with them in St. Louis, so it's a personal choice!  
  
Located in the Casino Royale, and the only location in the west coast;  It's conveniently sitting between Fat Tuesday and Walgreens.  And thank goodness for being 24/7, as it's a great pre- or post-party snack!  

Regarding service, it's fast food, not fine dining.  Luckily I had no issues with service, but what do you expect?  Just order and scarf them down!"
_8jrrsVmiHvjDrWKmLJzlA,"I think I was more excited about the fact that I got to finally try White Castle than I was about the actual food. My girls and I checked it out after a night of club hopping--and this food is perfect for that sort of situation. I HATE onions, but was so tired I ended up eating them anyway. The burgers weren't horrible, but they weren't amazing either. I know that folks say they're like Krystal's burgers, but I liked them better...although I couldn't tell you the last time I had anything from Krystal's.

All in all, the restaurant wasn't great, but being able to experience it during an awesome Vegas vacay made it worthwhile."
ZQeHd3xm8nn4U7iAevp7yg,My husband has always loved White Castle so of course once he found out there was one a block away from where we were staying (the Venetian) we had to stop in and grab a bite to eat! Thank god this place is 24 hours because the best time to eat it is when you're good and drunk and that is usually late but then again it's Vegas we are talking about! Lol when are you not good and drunk? Anyways!!!!! Awesome drunk food for sure! And it's nice that it's cheap too!
S8SmHLHbIKDEov4vOMklEw,"I've been buying White Castle slider burgers from the frozen section at Walmart for years and always wanted to try the real thing. I finally had the chance this past weekend while in Vegas and it was awesome. Everything I'd hoped it would be. My wife and I ordered 20 beef sliders, 2 small chicken rings, and 2 fries. It ended up being too much food but was still worth every penny I paid. Will definitely return on my next trip."
bm4yb9gtfk_jWl9dJFWpwg,They've lied to us people.... i don't know how they were able to make a movie about it.
HLYtHUK8dwAos8qP4Di2BQ,"It is over hyped. I've heard about how amazing this place was but it's actually ok. This place isn't bad, just did not even reach anywhere near my expectations."
TM874-GkP7pYlHaQt2AxFg,"OK I was born and raised in New Jersey where there is white castle all over the place I remember when he first got here to Las Vegas and me and my nanny and son went here for the first time

Yes it's the exact same but it is much larger and caters to a lot of tables and there is a beer offering and it's pretty cool how they fill the cups

The only thing that is a complaint is the fact that it's three times the cost as a normal white castle visit. 

This white castle did in fact run out of hamburgers when it opened on The strip I remember the day that it happened and it made headlines
It's kind of like a classy white castles if there such a thing"
mcyV-ubssRJHheWyBBsmmA,"OK, White Castle virgin.. I know, I know, but truth. Listen Vegas is an experience and so is White Castle apparently. Silly me, Saturday night on the strip, but friends were here from NYC and they insisted. Wait outside in a line of people walking past asking ""What are you in line for?"" Had to resist answering ""Hookers and Blow."" Then wait in a line inside, and folks they are SERIOUS about that line, to include security guards to direct traffic. 
Our troop goes in deep and orders a suitcase of burgers (a flippin suitcase of burgers) 2 onion rings (more like onion chunks, better than rings) and 1 fry. I have no idea what I am in for, but I am ready, I mean it is food, burgers and fries, hello.. Yes lord! This is a tasty burger! I don't care for pickles, so I toss em, but the burger itself is damn good.. About 4 bites (watching my table mates who apparently never eat in public is where I glean this information) and that burger is no more.
I will be back, someday.. It is on the strip, I avoid the strip for too many reasons to list. However, White Castle is a good lure, so it might be sooner rather than later.
TIP: Order more than you think you will eat, you don't want to get back in that line!"
VhxqLTnYoOideXOM000oUg,"Loads of interesting options. They have great combos, all sliders. If you are in a group better get their Castle packs which are great. The place is crowded, so ensure you have time to wait in line. Quick service though. Pretty organized.

Best part: they make their sliders fresher in front of you. They are NOT reheated when you order."
Nt58l-kgphWcTHdJenckTw,OMG! My favorite vacation spot meets my favorite burger! The sliders were delicious along with the iconic fries. I recommend everyone go here while on the strip
ZMM18cCsbNSWBjl65TxruQ,"It's been a few years since we had White Castle so when we found out they were opening a location in Vegas we wanted to visit.

I was little disappointed about the location. It is connected to Casino Royale and there is not much seating here. The restaurant was dirty and they didnt have any staff cleaning up the tables. The line was long but it did move fast. 

The burgers didnt taste good as I remembered. Maybe because it's been a few years but I was happy to get my White Castle fix."
sBLlhv6xniz3-t_uUdPO4Q,"This place is good! short lines and fast service. I ordered about 30 burgers and they came out fast, i ordered them for the drive home and my group ate them all before we can get half way home. Defiantly worth visiting here."
eoVRF5AzMVGi6jnI9TQOUw,"The grossest thing I've ever consumed. I would've been better off getting the frozen ones from the freezer section. I will never eat this place again. And after we complained they didn't even seem to care nor bother to help fix the situation. Save your money, go somewhere else!!"
gkwvUz4-8tHmUie2ghdeTA,"We don't have White Castle in California, so this was a must go for my husband. We loved the mini burgers! Preferred the original one patty more than the double. Bought extra to have in our condo for munchies and they reheated well in the microwave. Total yummers!"
1KhhvV93P0EIgq2tEXe_Zw,"I really enjoy the simplicity of these little sliders.  The onion chips are my favorite side.  The fries are average, but I'm not really a potato person in general.  The frozen cheesecake on a stick is worth the trip alone.   

I admit that when I first tried this place it took a while to grow on me, but now I really crave these simple little burgers.  I try to stop in every couple of weeks for a quick bite.  I avoid the weekend tourist crowds and always stop there for weekday lunch.  My parking experience has improved since I discovered the back entrance.  The only bad thing about this place is getting in and out of the parking lot, but that's not the restaurant's fault so I won't ding them for that.  I also get a kick out of the people walking out with two suitcases full of these things.  Like they're buying enough to feed a whole plane."
XBX0hMkitzd-ZySa3AlrPA,"It tastes like the frozen burgers i used to buy at the grocery stores. They do come in cute boxes though, and if you get a combo, its decently priced. 
Not too bad, but nothing to rave about. It's inside the Harrah's hotel."
rNugNF6r-dG98axFkz4ntA,"This isn't the best of anything by far but it's better fast food than the typical chains and their 24/7! And if your fan of the movie(Harold & Kumar) then you must try this place once cause those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store are fake and don't give White Castle anyway justice. 

I ordered a combo. 
*Sliders with cheese - Without the cheese they slider would suck so the cheese is good and def a must. 
*Fries - Crinkle cut and very lacking. Easy pass next time.
*Onion Fries - Your combo will be much better if you substitute for these. I like these a lot better. 

I would probably recommend on skipping on combos and getting a sack. Because 4 sliders aren't really enough. Anyways White Castle isn't anything special but it is appealing at 4-5 AM, if you don't want Hash House or Earls. 

The service is like any fast food joint. I asked for ranch and the lady said she had to go to back and get some. I waited 5 minutes and she didn't move at all. She had the easiest job of handing out sauces and she couldn't even do that smh."
V5VhmJiLFksQol0m0NjkKA,"I stopped at White Castle around 4 A.M. since it was near my hotel and open 24/7. I ordered 3 classic sliders while my friends ordered the original slider combo. The line was long and took me 10 minutes to order and another 10 minutes to get my food. 

When I got my food, I was disappointed. In no way did that resemble a burger slider. The bottom bun was so soggy that it stuck to the packaging. The burger patty was probably 3 millimeters thick. It came with one pickle and grilled onions. The fries were soggy as well and tasted like plastic. The fries tasted like they were frozen and reheated in a microwave. To top it off, the food was not worth the money. It costs almost $10 for a slider combo (drink, fries, 3 slider). I paid $1.30 for each slider that you could finish in 2 bites. The best part of the meal was the drink.

The food here closely resembles the frozen, microwaved lunch you get in elemenatry school. One star because it is open 24/7."
pOGiHnBqvMjaPLRjLmCLNw,"White Castle?  My Wife and I were so excited to try this place and it was a major let-down.  First off the food- ok the sliders are good, not great, and definitely nothing to rave about.  The fries and mozzarella sticks are phenominal.  Why the 3 stars???  Because the price, I know its the strip but for four slides, two small fries, two small drinks, and an order of mozzarella sticks, $27!!!???? You gotta be kidding me!?  All in all i wont be back anytime soon.  Thanks for nothing Harold and Kumar. 

P.S. note to management wipe down the tables and pick up trash once in awhile.  Never too busy to keep up routine cleaning..."
yVzqZZqx14Xy11XxdviCmg,"OK, fact not the best burger in the world. Fact not the best slider in the world. However it is a regional thing. People flock to In-N-Out burger as soon as they land in Vegas not because it's the the best burger but because they grew up with in-n-out and the want the nostalgic feeling from their childhood. Just like many of us go to Chic-Fil-A every time we go to California!  Service was friendly, dinning area was clean and the food was hot. If you have never had W/C give it a try you may just like it. If you want a GREAT Burger try the Burger Bar."
-e3BEs5Hm84AldD49RrMpQ,"I've always wanted to try White Castle, even before the movie came out and now that I've tried it...it's nothing special.  I would rather have In and Out or eat at McD.  The burgers lacked any flavor but at least the buns were good.  I should've just went to Shake Shack against my better judgement.  The best part of the meal was the chicken ring sandwich.  Too bad 2 meals of chicken ring sandwiches and two sliders costed 25 bucks.

Never again."
8VrxW0QArvo3Gx8p06_93w,"Well Saturday night is over and what a better way to finish it than stop in for a few white castles, a Coke and some chili cheese fries"
5KhSHUXS4zlw2NR2KcRRhw,My wife had bragged about White Castle for a long time about how good their sliders were and how you could eat a whole sack of them.  When we got to White Castle my wife immediately ordered 20 for the two of us.  After trying one slider I was so disappointed the burger was so bland and nasty.  My wife was equally as disappointed and we both opted to throw them away rather than suffer through trying to eat them... Extremely disappointed and sad for my wife who thought she was going to enjoy a childhood favorite... I had better burger at McDonalds.
qbS4Wbh9B7a5zBFOtOcqqA,"This was my first trip ever to White Castle. I ordered 2 original sliders, 1 with cheese, and a side of fries. I have to say, I'm a big fan of the fluffy bread and onions. Fries were decent too, and not greasy. I usually just order hamburgers, but I must admit these sliders are much better with some cheese. 

White Castle is def a good snack as you walk along the Blvd. looking for trouble. Best to go during weird hours because that line can be Disneyland-long."
NlRqO8D_zq9HdZYMwVhA6w,"I was excited to find a White Castle in Vegas mostly being from the east coast living in the west coast. The sliders were delicious and the staff were friendly. Although white castles don't have the best dinning ambiance the steamed, soft, melt in your mouth sliders is where it's at. I recommend you have the order to go to take back to your hotel as seating here is limited and kind of in a busy casino area."
LiHFd-WeqzCEdp2MSoORzA,"Ok so for those of us who have never ever had a White Castle from an actual ""White Castles"" I was so freaking stoked about my visit to this holy grail. I truly believe I had the  exact same feeling that Harold and Kumar had when they finally arrive at the place where they have been dying to get to all because they have been yearning for those little magical sliders in the pretty little white box.

As I stepped through the double glass door from the Las Vegas strip and entered this gold mine I was filled with happiness. Who would have ever thought that we would be so lucky to have a White Castle here, but I guess dreams do come true.

The line was not bad and space was pretty small and yes they only have 2 cash register but there was an army of workers in the back cranking out them sliders and the food came out fast. As I am placing my order I am still in disbelief that I didn't have to travel to the east coast to experience this must try burger joint. Any how that was just it. I am giving them a 4 stars because although everything was great the burger itself the one thing that this place is all so famous for was good but I wish was better by being hot and fresh. 

I totally understand that in order to meet demands and keep customers happy by getting their food quick they must constantly pump out burgers and let them sit there, and that's where it suffers I think. I burgers itself was a little cold. But never the less I was extremely content. I ordered almost every item on the menu because even though I wish it was a hope skip and a jump, it is not easy for us locals to just drive up and pick us up a bag full of burgers...no you must be strategic about it and actually plan your day to enjoy this place and it's food. 

All in all everything was good and I defiantly will be back again and again. I'm crossing my fingers they will open up other locations where we can just pull up to a drive thru and satisfy our cravings a little easier. I think I have been building up the anticipation about White Castles since the movie Harold and Kumar and never thought I would ever get to taste them or get to one without actually leaving Vegas but now I can. So say what you want about this place I am just so happy that after all these years I Finally Made it to WHITE CASTLES!!!! Thank you for opening one up in Vegas. 

Oh and the staff was super nice too!!! 
***OOPS I PUT THIS PLACE IS DRESSY BUT I MEANT CASULE*** I hope we all could figure that out! LOL"
rNVo-YnSbz2Gp95SY03yog,"1st time I had white castle sliders... woo-hoo!  very delicious!  cheap, yummy and fast on the strip!  i like their fries - which are not salty, and chicken rings ! open up in canada, will ya!?"
dwMPmjaiKld_iJd1VYAXyw,They list this place as a fast food restaurant but more like a SLOW food Restraunt! The manager should be taken out back and beaten! 4th of July holiday and they have one person working a register and a line out the door! Heaven for bid the manager throws a few more employees on registers to speed up the process or hops on one himself! Worst run business! If u see a line go somewhere else like I did after waiting 30 minutes and not moving as it will be a two hour wait just to order!The debate of $15/hour makes me laugh when I see how a business like this is run! Can't wait till the day they replace workers with computers so we can place our own orders and not have to wait an hour in line at a Slow food Restraunt!
6N49RrfcstqL2_gBvdJ7jA,I didn't expect  much being that they only had sliders. But it was surprisingly  good. The grilled onions make it worth it. Definitely  enjoyed our dinner date on the strip!!!!
TcrcCc9muYxTOgldqVadog,"Jalapeño double and onion chips/loaded fries are just so good, not anything like the frozen cheeseburgers quality. Get some Dusseldorf mustard and zesty sauce on the side."
2uRu9VGJQBp6Afwpj3GMyw,"Food wasn't that good. I spend about $50 trying different things on the menu but it just wasn't worth it. Flavorless. Employees were friendly though, so that's a plus. Harold and Kumar should have gone elsewhere!"
UVC1I1l1fIek2HY7i-YS6w,"It's White Castle. It's its own entity. It's not a hamburger as West Coasters (myself included) think of when you hear the word 'Hamburger'. Once you get into the idea that you're eating something completely different, you're on the road to success.

I fell in love with these little onion-y meat and bun nuggets in Kentucky. I suppose if you hate onions, you'll hate this. The onions are cooked and the patties and buns are stacked on top steaming everything with that onion-y goodness. These were every bit as good as the ones I've had in Kentucky. 

Pro Tip: Get a side of onion chips, and order by the sack."
XUhfo8vvSumYkxB7yAtFrg,"I've been craving White Castle ever since Harold and kumar came out. I was elated when I heard they were coming to the west coast and was not disappointed. I'm surprised the location is so small so I can only imagine how quickly it fills up. I got the 2 double slider combo and was blown away. So meaty and cheesy, with the onions and pickle to cut through. No condiments necessary."
r06ZJBNv5vaZehzdLEaAaA,I love White Castle so I was excited one was out my way!! But the parking is horrific because it's located on the strip!!! Sooo wish they would add another location with a drive thru in another area of vegas!
A6vbq6tg7g1nJkhhJSCmiQ,"My husband and I had never been to White Castle before so we decided to give them a try out of curiosity. We stopped by on Saturday afternoon around 5:30, it took 45 minutes to wait and order, then another 10 to receive our meal which wasn't too bad.

We were able to find a little spot to sit in really quick, the table was clean but the space was tiny. The employees that I dealt with were friendly. 

I can say that I am glad we took the safe route and ordered very little food, better safe than sorry. I got combo #2 which comes with 4 cheese sliders, an order of fries and a drink for $8.99, I also ordered 6 additional cheese sliders, an order of onion chips, and a fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick (additional burgers were for the kids at home). I ordered all of the cheese sliders without onions. When our number was called my husband picked up the order and brought it back to the table. I opened the bag up and noticed no cheese and onions on the first slider, so it took out one after another and noticed they all had no cheese but they did all have onions, on top of that, I didn't receive my cheesecake. I put the sliders back in the bag and took them back, they threw the sliders away and I waited another 10 minutes to receive the ""correct"" order. First 4 sliders were fine, cheese and no onions, other 6, cheese with onions. WTF! My receipt clearly stated cheese and no onions for all 10 sliders! At that point I was annoyed so I didn't take them back to the front counter, but seriously, you must really not know what you're doing if you get my order wrong twice. To top it off the burgers were semi-warm, they should be glad I didn't become very disgruntled.

I honestly wasn't impressed with the tiny burgers, I took a bite and to my surprise, it tasted just like a McDonald's $1 cheeseburger. The slider consisted of a bun, thin patty, and sliced pickles. The fries weren't anything special either, they tasted just like the crinkle cut fries that you buy at the grocery store and fry up yourself. Onion chips were okay, they were very crisp and had a semi sweet taste to them. The best part of the meal was my orange fanta beverage and the fudge dipped cheesecake on a stick. We spent $25 on our meal and thought it was a complete waste. Meal #2 comes with enough food to fill up a hungry toddler, not an adult. The cost is not justifiable to me, too little food for the price, $1.50 for a tiny cheese slider, no thanks. 

I came, I tasted, too over-hyped."
J76Hu13cIN89ACpnOqohyg,"I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world. 
Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol
DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. 
Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings? 
Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning."
6KQ7noqvPbH4ibkAyZw2Dw,Service was quick. Sliders are bomb. It's White Castle. Need I say more. Go there. Stuff your face. Drink a beer.
nX7j7lklZ_jdE8BnSXeyKA,"Service was good.  The cleanliness was a bit lacking as staff was not clearing tables very quickly.  This would be 1 start if they didn't sell beer...

The sliders are okay at best; I am unsure of where all of the hype comes from.  If fast food burgers are your goal, I would pick In-N-Out before going to White Castle.  If you compared it to any sort of restaurant style burger, you would remove White Castle from your memory, never to be thought of again.  

Don't want to make the journey to WC?  The frozen versions from the Super Market are just as good as at WC."
26RMP24EDZ-K7kTRYl-Uzg,"Located inside Casino Royal. Hubby and I had the late night munchies after a bit of a shopping. The line was kind of long, about a 15-20 minute wait then an additional 10 min wait.

This was my second time eating White Castle. Their sliders were delicious. We ate a lot of them on the ride home. They are small and perfect, I don't get the same guilt trip I do when I eat other burgers. I tried the chicken sliders for the first time, it's not my cup of tea, I just don't think that chicken should be a burger, I also tried their bacon cheese fries, oh my."
TNaEVa4F1gG4K_xkN8YsfA,"In a word, yuuuuuummmmmm!!!! So glad to find a White Castle out west! We walked from the New York New York casino up the vegas strip just to have some of these sliders and they were definitely worth it!!!!! Staff was friendly, kept the area clean which made our experience even better."
HuRqdDNm6WVwCotTZAVlfg,I like the fish sliders the best. The chicken sliders are the fries kind of dry. The cheese burgers are good I can do with out the fries...
dx7MM3qe883RoymRAJ9Vkw,"To be fair, I've only had the frozen Costco version of these baby burgers and was only introduced to the chain by watching ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle."" Yup! My husband has never had WC before so we decided to give it a go. 

Located at the Best Western Casino Royale, it'll hit you in the face if you're walking down the strip towards Venetian. There are security guards standing at the doors and inside to monitor the lines. We came in at 10ish and were in and out in less than an hour. Guess everyone was still sleeping. By the time we left, the line was out the door!!!
About the food:
-Original Slider- plain as can be. Onions, beef patty
-Cheeseburger Slider- comes with a pickle, onion and cheese. I liked this one best. Had the best flavor because of the pickle. 
-Chicken Ring Slider- two chicken rings with cheese. I wouldn't order it again and now understand why it needs the cheese. Without it.. Kinda dry.
Fries- crinkle cut. Standard!

The boo is a fan of the cheeseburgers goodness. My beef (hehe) is that I'm not a fan of the soggy buns. Sorry! I understand it's that way because of the onions soaking the flavor into them but... I like my buns firm ;)"
Z_QijfbyBjb-JWqiDPWrxA,"Well, I finally made it to a White Castle.  It is what it is and it doesn't try to be anything more.  And that's basically how a 24-hour food joint on the strip should be.  Be noted that I came here right after having a Filet Mignon at Mon Ami Gabi, so I really came in here with lower expectations.

I like cheeseburgers so I went with their Castle Combo No. 2 which had 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink (http://bit.ly/1d7fHzH).  I can describe these little cheeseburgers in two words:  Salt Bombs!  These little suckers were pretty damn salty.   I think after every bite I just keep going for my soda to soak it all up.  Despite the saltiness, the cheeseburgers weren't that bad!  But it might be because I had some alcohol beforehand.  And definitely better than getting them frozen ones at the supermarket.  For just under $10, the combo was decent.

Luckily when I arrived to White Castle at around 10:30pm, there wasn't a line to order.  So my experience was pretty quick as it should be.  But when I walked by at around midnight, the place was super packed so I was glad that I just had beat the late night munchie rush.  Amazing!

Despite the novelty, I don't know if I'd come back to White Castle again.  If I want a burger on the Strip late at night, there are plenty of other options at around the same price range."
XBEowW6g7zMGJzOE31DXRg,"I honestly don't really see the hype about this place either. Ate here about two or three times during EDC week, because it was right next to our hotel, opened late (maybe even 24 hours?) and is cheap.

The burgers are okay, cute and little but not really flavorful. Bland I might add. Fries are okay too. The best item on their menu is probably the chicken rings, and they're not even known for that. 

The employees are rude and the food doesn't really come out as fast as you would think for a fast food joint. . .

Oh Harold & Kumar, you guys definitely got my hopes up. I can see how one may find this place delicious if under the influence of marijuana."
liaEdz5jJ_4oQeP6w96r9w,"Simply put - their burgers/sliders suck. I walked in with pretty low expectations and they didn't even meet that. But you're likely going to check out White Castle anyway whether it's out of morbid curiosity like I did, or because of nostalgia. 

I stopped by on opening day because I was walking distance away and had a friend already in line. The line moved relatively quickly, but White Castle way underestimated the wait time. It's nice that they handed out free sliders as a sorry, but ironically that well intended gesture made me consider getting out of line after sampling their sliders. But I promised to bring WC back for other people, so stayed in line.

Great service for a fast food place especially on opening day. Everybody was helpful nice, and smiley despite all the chaos - I read they were churning out around 4,000 sliders an hour, which is insane. 

I've never been to another WC before, but heard that they're normally priced around 80cents each vs the cheapest you'll get it here is $1.09 with the 100 pack. They can say the higher prices are due to higher rent on the strip, but that's bs - they would've made up for that with the ridiculously high volume this location will do, so they're just plain greedy. But what can you do - it's the only WC west of... think it was Missouri? 

Anyway, back to their crappy burgers. Yes I know that sliders are small, but paying over $1 for something that's 1/18th of a pound of weird gray ""beef"" is just silly. For comparison, a McDonalds hamburger (also crappy) is 1/10th of a pound and at least looks more like real beef than this does. The bun was ok and I like grilled onions, but I did not enjoy tasting them for the rest of my day.  

I guess it's WC's thing that they never dress the sliders for you - want some ketchup and mustard? Too bad, you get grilled onions and pickles - anything else you have to add to it yourself. Not a huge deal, except that you need to know to ask for it, then wait for the guy to get packets from the back because they don't have them out to just grab. And he only gave me 1 packet each of ketchup, mustard and mayo for 10 sliders, so thanks for that because ketchup and mustard were the only things that gave the burger any taste.  

Also ordered a chocolate shake because the lady said they're amazing since they're made from frozen custard not ice cream or soft serve. It was a decent but overpriced shake, which was so thick that I couldn't drink it through a straw. I have no idea if that's how they always are, but a spoon would've been nice. 

I would normally say well I didn't like it, however you should probably try it out for yourself. In this case I have to say eff it - skip the lines and the clusterf*ck we call the strip and just pick up the frozen ones from the market. They sadly do taste about the same and I think are cheaper."
Z9d6iJlJg64ELkRh_8oYsA,"I'd like to start this review with a question. On an average day how many sliders does this place serve? Pretty curios about that. Anyways anybody that grew up back east should know White Castle. This is the first location in the west so of course it had to go on Las Vegas Blvd. Not sure what some people were expecting or built up in their minds about this place. It's exactly the same it's always been just higher prices (not extreme though) because of the location. As a Vegas local and someone that grew up with eating here I can say it's good but not deserving of more than 3 stars. 

PROS
Same White Castle you have always had. If you enjoyed them in the past you will enjoy them here
They serve beer which is pretty cool 
Dining area seems to be well kept and clear of trash 

CONS
Location..  Good for the company I'm sure but locals absolutely hate coming to the strip. I understand why the first one had to go here but wish now there was an easier one outside of the strip to get to 
Size.. As I said well kept and clean but not nearly big enough for the amount of foot traffic that comes through. 
Some employees... Look I work with drunk asshole tourists everyday too so I understand what they go through but there are some (not all) here that have just  nasty attitudes. Granted it's a few bad apples but they leave an impression. A few times the fries were old/cold and asked politely for new ones and have been met with sighs and eye rolls. Please expand into the local area!"
lpSOGhNDdnJ_fVPA9a_r6g,"When I heard about White Castle coming to Vegas, I honestly got excited about it. I've never been to one of their locations before but I figured it would be a cool experience, especially seeing it practically get famous from Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (I can't believe that movie is 11 years old now!)

Located on the Casino Royale side of the Strip, White Castle offers cheap sliders at any time of the day. I honestly think it's better than most fast food chains, but it tasted the same as the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store.

The breakfast slider was pretty good, though. It really isn't anything special because it's just a sausage patty with an egg, but it does the trick if you want something simple and filling for breakfast.

It's not a gourmet burger joint, but it's definitely nice to have one of these on the Strip. The cheap prices and better quality food than other fast food chains are what makes White Castle a winner in my book! It might be a little too over-hyped, but it's still a place to visit just to say you've been to one."
jJmZl9Jgf3fnHZe0PfxQlw,"It's located in castle royals, a junky little hotel...kind of gross & concerned me to it there. Food was ok, but not good enough to go out of my way to go again."
BBo7YLXSY76pmn35o9Myzw,"This place is unexpectedly good!!!  For a Southern California girl who has only ever eaten these things frozen I went in with pretty low expectations.  But wow!  They were warm and fresh and just good!  The onion fries were also a nice surprise.  I forgot to order the chocolate dipped cheesecake which was a bummer.  Next time!!  If you have never been here, I recommend ordering a few extra burgers. They go down easy, I ate three of them no problem!  Perfect snack after a day of drinking!  Down side is the line is long but that seems to be a Vegas thing anywhere you go!  I will be back."
ETeeIGSUOKemFOc995iYBw,This small square burgers are a joke. This mini burgers aren't clean and made me and my family go toilet three times. The tables aren't clean. It is way overprice and it's not even funny. It's over hype. Don't come here. My stomach still hurts from this shit these mass production tiny burgers are. Please don't come here. The kumer movie is fake. That's why I came here. It's tastes horrible. Other customers are saying it's a joke. This place is not clean.
ZyraVfzW3WSv7mMsofdZ6g,It was good enough now it isnt in n out but in n out has about a 30-45 min wait if you are walking the strip and looking for a burger that is quick and easy and good than white castle it is and ive tried the fancy burger places and they are about the same and longer wait at those places glad to see a white castle
RKXeUjZs-M1Pa7OaIrj_Ag,"It's fast food people. Nothing over the top or special just a perfect snack when you have the munchies and wanna eat 10-15 sliders in one sitting and feel bad about yourself after breaking your diet lmao 

For me it's a throwback from when I was a kid eating those little burgers on the tailgate of my mom's station wagon at the drive in movies in Indiana.

I moved to California and was excited to hear they opened a location in vegas because I wanted to taste a memory.  

100% the same since I was 5 y.o. everything taste exactly the way I remembered.  

10 soft little burgers and we'll done crinkle cut fries :) I felt guilty after eating it just like I would any other fast food binge eating session hahaha 

I see bad reviews.  Don't overthink it people.  It's only fast food.  Enjoy responsibly"
DFnIoIZVyM0tab6KmFCp8A,"Ok, I'm from Southern California, so I never really got the whole White Castle craze, since it was never in California to begin with. 

A recent trip to Las Vegas with my Chicago born girlfriend certainly changed it around for me. First, it's not the in and out type burger most will want. It's a small steamed burger, and it tastes great. Small sliders that are bite sized is what White Castle is all about. Quick service and overall great place in my mind.

Yes, the prices were high, but drive 1200 more miles if you want the closer one, and you'll pay the higher than normal prices for them there. It's Vegas, get over it, most of everything in Vegas is overpriced. 

Great times and good food."
5ZW2uDA6WwbZhGcWQCHkvg,"I used to eat these when I was a teen, so I was super hyped when they opened here in LV...I went down to the strip (no parking) I ordered 10 sliders $16.00 they were 49 cents each 20 years ago???? they were so greasy I almost could not digest 2 of them. Know I know why my mother used to say when I was a kid that every time she ate them she got the runs...."
B7DFrNlEG_mNjMYx-mb9Hg,"Had to come check this place out, I'd never had a fresh White Castle burger and I was not disappointed. I got the 4 cheeseburgers with fries and a drink, it tasted fresh and was nice and hot. The onions were a tasty addition and even though I could only finish three of the burgers and half the fries, it was really tasty! Would definitely go back."
iYpxZbgdtX6iWKeywIoJig,"What can I say? It's White (mo fawkin) Castles!!
Only complaint is we need some in California. I've been writing them for 30 years BEGGING!"
7Jbmdy_cQRk3RhbP8NLMgQ,The food was ok.  All the workers looked like they hated being here.  All looked unhappy. The cashier seemed nice.  Slow as molasses.  I cashier for about 50 people in line.  What a mess this place is
B2duHAXlpC5U33DB-J5YTw,Perfect east coast addition to the strip.  Sliders were just like I remembered.  Service was quick and easy.
TQf7fjo0PAflPOMk1xRs1Q,Have been wanting to try this place after seeing it in the movie years ago.  finally one here in Vegas but we were not fans.
tjx1eoW8RG72_g22CX00VQ,"Yay!  White Castle west of the Rockies!!!!!  Well located and easy to get in/out.  Inside of the Casino Royale - next to Walgreens. Menu as you have memorized.  

Advice:  Go in the daytime, buy a sack and put the leftovers in your room fridge for a late night snack.  Oh so good.  You'll thank me at 3am after a night at Omnia.....

Special shout out to the Saturday morning staff (9am - 7/30/16)  Super friendly and fast service.  Kudos!!"
_7nDnRspBqqR8ca9bR_oPA,"Sadly didn't live up to the hype.

I've had frozen White Castle in the past. 

And who can resist coming here after watching Harold and Kumar go to White Castle :-)

Anyway it wasn't bad but left me thinking.. ""Hey McDonald's is better.""

Burgers - Good, expected them to come out hotter though since I could see them making it in front of my face.  Seems that they just serve the ones that have been sitting a bit though.  GIVE ME THE FRESH ONES!
Fries - Mediocre.
Chicken Ring Burger - Nah, just cheese on 2 chicken ring.
Fish Burger - Okay but no condiments.. just cheese on a piece of fried fish."
lvvKxCQJoQU1McDoEmEH0g,"This was my first time in a White Castle. I took the long line as a good sign. The music, videos playing, conversations, and sights made the long wait in line not so bad. Once we got our orders, we were able to find a seat, surprisingly. Burgers were cooked well. Chicken rings were crunchy."
kyJwSQbBO-RoS8U72kZc-Q,"Ever since I was a kid listening to the Beastie Boys rap about White Castle, I have always wanted to go there. Living in So Cal, we don't have the opportunity.  Low and behold signs on the way to Vegas advertising for White Castle. 

No traffic, no crowds, no parking issue was going to keep us from going.  Park behind and walk to the front of the strip location. 

The customer service was great, the location is clean and inviting and the food was so, so delicious.

The burgers were just as good as I had hoped, and the dipping sauce zangy sauce was OUTSTANDING.  I tried to find a copycat recipe of it online, but have failed.  

I will definitely, be back when in Vegas again! 

Love White Castle."
7stXP4Gn31uVVTwmUEdehQ,"Authentic and typical White Castle...Except it's on the Las Vegas Strip.
-Typical White Castle food, either you like it or you don't.
-Prices are a bit steep, but it's a high rent location.
-This location serves Beer!
-Good central location on the Strip.
-Friendly employees.
-Restaurant was clean.
If you want a White castle hamburger and not frozen from a supermarket...this is your only option on the west coast."
3mYr4ajn8WFNTtzgD8GGPg,"I really had no desire to try White Castle. After seeing all the horrendous pictures of the barely edible-looking food, I was pretty sure I would never go, I was wrong.

Out of sheer morbid curiosity, we arrived at White Castle a few weeks ago and saw no line and figured it was as good a time to try as any. 

We shared some sliders with cheese and chicken rings along with some fries. Prices were a bit steep, but that's to be expected for the strip. 

I was surprised that the food wasn't as awful as I was expecting. It wasn't necessarily good, either. I favored the chicken rings to the sliders, which as people have noted are steamed and therefore have a mushy texture that I didn't enjoy. The fries were forgettable, so I'd avoid those.

Their drink and ice machines weren't working and people were bottle necking fighting for the one side that was actually functioning. 

All in all, I guess I'm glad I gave them a try, but it looks like one and done for me."
aPyCyPLI8vBzU7MbTAmOWQ,I was not wowed at all. We just wanted to try it. Had sliders and fries. Meat is thin. Buns are good but greasy. Too much butter. Fries are soft. Super crowded and seating is limited. I don't know what I was expecting but I left unsatisfied.
zTshMlGk9o3xPykic-E5mg,"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!?!?!?

A White Castle on the West Coast of America?! 

So to my surprise, I spot this gem and we decide to stop in and make it a White Castle kind of night.

For a whopping $27-we got 10 cheese sliders, 2 cheese fries, and 2 drinks.

Well worth it. So yum! Yeah, it's crap fast food but we couldn't pass it up.

Girl at the front was super nice. It didn't seem like anyone hated their job. 

There was a constant line, so obviously business is well. Place was clean-they kept wiping up and such.

Overall, I'll stop in again next time I'm in Vegas and if they are still there."
wqexdLlpTdTRDhe8oQ87lg,"I wish we had these in Canada!!

Can't say too much other than the sliders are heavenly  and hit the spot EVERYTIME! 

The bun is soft and a bit sweet. Meat is never dry. 

Ok I'm drooling...
Time for another road trip."
uxdh0cgWLAqhZM7wPecy-Q,"This Minnesota boy is now happy.  Las vegas finally gets with the program and White Castle learns a lesson in economics (you go where your rabid fans are).
yes it's a square, little hamburger. Yes, it was copied by some Schmuck named Krystal  from the south who claims he had the idea when visiting St Louis World fair..   

Some people pay premium dollar to say they have an iPhone, some people pay a price to eat a small, square burger that has its onions and buns steamed with the burger...  

This one serves beer... Bonus Points!!"
jlEmzlLHaIDY3qgViFGFYQ,"Looked good when Harold and Kumar ate it in the movie. Thought we gave it a try since it opened here. Much more costly than other states i heard as it's suppose to be a quarter each. We got 4 cheeseburger sliders with a drink and fries and it was $8.99.

The sliders were pretty gross. I think some frozen sliders even taste better. The bread were soggy on the bottom as if my bun was accidentally dropped in water. What makes it worse is its not water but the bun soaked up the fat juice from the meat (which some may like but a soggy bun, no thank you). The meat looked old and not fresh at all. One picture that a fellow yelper posted says it all. 

Service was ok. Some were super nice while some looked as if they just crawled out of bed or have a bad hangover. Definitely a one time visit for me. Never again."
B8cvjCQQQz_TCDPTFRsHSQ,"White Castle in Vegas ? Whaaaat ?  oh yeh, these were amazing little burgers.  I've had these when I was in Ohio a few years ago and haven't seen a real location out on this coast except in Vegas.  Give them a try."
to-anIHquTzAUdZRKwGBIA,"Alright, I've had White Castle once before this. I still don't get what the hype is about.

I waited in line on grand opening night for a little less than two hours, met one new person (while waiting in line with) to be honest I was mostly excited to see the employees because as the they were leaving/entering all were excited. 

I payed a little less than $20 tax included for 4 sliders (okay), 2 sodas, 1 chicken ring box thing(mediocre), and a tiny cheesecake on a stick. 

The cashier that helped me was great! They didn't seemed overwhelmed at all despite the line going out and around the corner of the street. 

What's the 5 stars for?

Because I'd go back for those tiny cheesecake sticks."
Uy54cfMrRSgm0TMNfg99og,"This is the very 1st White Castle to have opened in the West Coast!  It opened on January 27th, 2015; and it was the very 1st time in 56 years that a White Castle has expanded in a different state.
 
The 1st time I ever had a White Castle slider was back in the 90's when Costco used to sell them in their freezer section.  I didn't even know that they were a fast food chain since there weren't any in the West Coast.  After Costco stopped selling these, I never heard of White Castle again until the film ""Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle"" was released in 2004.  Ever since I saw that movie, I've always had a craving for White Castle.  When I went to New York in 2008, it was the very 1st time that I ever dined at a White Castle establishment.
 
When I went to Las Vegas in 2015, I was pleasantly surprised to see this White Castle since they've only had their restaurants in the mid-West & the East Coast.  I had to give them a try!  This is a cleaner White Castle than their other locations, and it was fun to sit by the window and ""people-watch"" the folks walking on the strip.  As for the food.., it's your typical White Castle.  Small portions & very greasy.  You always have to order more sliders than you think, if you just have a normal appetite; and even more sliders if you're really hungry!  What makes this White Castle unique is that they serve breakfast items from 5am - 11am, and they also sell cold draft beer.
 
It's a good place to get cheap food at any hour of the day/night.  In the past, the only place to get 24/7 fast food was at McDonald's.  It's a novelty to finally have a White Castle in the West Coast; but at the end of all things.., it's still just a fast food chain.  It's just nice to have another alternative than the McDonald's on the Las Vegas strip."
EsRBQuUnLro5LzeQ6LHWuw,"Yes we went again. My first review was lower only because the Las Vegas prices are higher than what I'm used to in the Detroit area. Food was fine. 

This time we looked past the prices and just fixated on the food. The burgers were as good as any WC anywhere but the fries weren't exactly fresh. So while I could knock them for the fries, it's a White Castle and it was a WC experience  

The line wasn't long, the wait for the food was alright and the burgers were as good as any. They don't serve win mustard and ketchup but when you have such a massive operation as the LV location you make allowances. 

Kudos for a great ""dinner"". Work on those fries and we'll be back monthly because.....it's White Castle baby!"
WIMfttdUbsmFaaSQRuwqQA,"I'm a Canadian on a burger mission so obviously I had to try White Castle. It's not as bad as everybody says it is!! The burger meat is weirdly thin and I question what kind of meat was used, but combined with the fried onion topping it's a pretty tasty burger! The fries sucked though. They were just bland.

The old man working the cash was extremely nice. After we told him we're from Canada and it was our first time at WC he gave us a rundown of how they make their burgers and pointed to each station behind him as he explained the cooking process to us. He won a place in my heart that day.

My only negative comment (other than the fries) was I thought it was going to be cheaper?? Maybe I got Vegas pricing..."
U5bgn4kTFtYmFnkjsPMCJg,"Greasy-gross-burped up that nasty onion taste the rest of the night. This place is not for me. Buns were good.

I'm changing my review the responder is correct there are other items to try :)

It's still fun to say u went there like Harold and Kumar lol"
bs0AWaO4mKe0X2ONj0ALnA,I think I will stick with the frozen ones.  The prices are overpriced and almost twice as much as the frozen ones that taste almost the same.
J_ua1-zkuFaVl4a60qEmhQ,"Save yourself a handful of dollars, time, and driving-on-the-strip-ness and just buy a box of frozen ones at your local grocer. They'll taste better than the ones here and you won't have to deal with a casino full of smoke and other aggravations.

Expensive, long line, nowhere to sit and eat in the place itself, even at odd hours of the morning. Enjoy sitting in the dark food court away from the place itself.

The fries were pretty bad, too, somehow stale even with as busy as it was."
-krR-tKY4u-9KxB9JVNasA,Wow! I had always wanted to try these burgers since watching Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle a number of years ago. They did not disappoint. These sliders are so different than any Burger I have had before. The service was friendly and we didn't have to wait long. Can't wait to go back for more.
fGUDIyckIk86xWk_uuqcWQ,"I don't know what happened, but I recall drinking heavily and then waking up the next morning with a big box of white castle burgers.  Now I have never had white castle but I saw these little guys off of the Harold and Kumar movie so I knew I'd like to try them some day.  I didn't know that I would have them off of a drunken stupor, and I'm glad I did, because hung over me was very appreciative of these little guys.

I would like to try to eat here again in passing, without any alcoholic influence, so who knows maybe one day I will!"
2vs_QSnuu9IphMBaK9HsHw,One of the trifecta of burger establishments and on my list it is number 3. The location jams this eatery between to other stores and makes it hard to find if not for the giant castle on the front. This is definitely a drunk food choice. Nothing better than downing as much as you can late at night when most other places are closed. A great place to experience. But maybe only experience once.
qO_yFcs3mKi7Kt2rMc6zCg,"Came here after some cocktails in the club. 

While it hit the spot, it took forever to order 

I will say this - it tasted better than the one I went to in New York City - but I think it is official - there is no reason for White Castle to be as popular as it is, except that perhaps people who love it do not know S*** about food lol."
Cg3S7dZufTdcevW_ebFkDg,"My experience here was not how I envisioned it. I envisioned my experience at White Castle the same as Harold and Kumar, enjoying endless sliders in absolute joy, basically having the best meal of my young life. Unfortunately that does not hold true and eating at White Castle makes me appreciate In-N-Out that much more. 

The sliders here are very thin, soggy, and underwhelming. They do have a strong flavor of onion as they are grilled on a bed of onions. The price of each slider is pretty ridiculous at 1.29 each because you need about 4-5 to be anywhere near satisfied. 

I happened to enjoy the chicken ring slider, as it was fulfilling and lathered with some liquid crack, in the form of cheese, which was very pleasant to eat. If I was hella drunk out of my mind I would probably order 20 of these easy. 

The onion peels take on the shape of a garlic clove and are deep fried. They taste just like onion rings and are not anything too special at all. 

I wouldn't mind coming back to White Castle if it somehow it magically ended up in the Bay Area, but if I'm in Vegas again, I would definitely waste my money on something actually worth spending on."
DzYxTjrim8T5Kh4HLQY1vA,Thankful the 'belly bombers' are now on Vegas. I was raised on White Castle ;)  nothing beats those grilled onions! I usually order a dozen with cheese and a dozen without.  Recently tried the fudge dipped brownie!
60-YRgTUMWpEazVy6vWdiA,"White Castle!  I grew up in the midwest and used to eat this sliders all the time!  Since I heard they opened up in Vegas, I was determined to come here again.  Same great taste as I remembered, but the prices in Vegas were a lot higher.  Inflation right?  Ordered some sliders at night and a crave case to go!

It's amazing you either love white castle or hate it.  I love it!i"
Rwp1Mc0FKEhVYrPk0IDVhw,"First time eating at White Castle. We've all seen the movie....so I was stoked to finally check this off the bucket list. I was, unfortunately, disappointed. My issue lies not with the staff or cleanliness of the restaurant....even the prices were not bad. It's the food! The sliders taste EXACTLY like the frozen ones sold in your local grocer's freezer. If I did the Pepsi challenge with a frozen slider and one from the restaurant....I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Skip it."
zeTY1S4MlmPlqWVK9PSfag,"White Castle is okay. I ordered the two chicken burgers meal and my friend ordered the two cheeseburgers meal. I also got ranch and honey mustard as a side and that was a good call on my part as the chicken burgers were kind of dry. The cheeseburgers tasted just like the frozen ones. The fries were okay. Basically, everything was just okay. Cheap late night drunk food. But I would go to Earls any day over White Castle."
iuGzuKw0Uv5cdxhMqaIeCQ,"White Castle finally came to the west coast, but it's certainly not the best on our coast. Everyone is curious about White Castle and what they have to offer. All we had before were the microwaveable burgers, and that certainly cannot match up to a restaurant's quality of burgers, right? 

Well... White Castle is certainly good, but maybe not as good as we hoped. I would say it is slightly better in the store than it is from the frozen burgers. One view I have is that the bread and meat is not cooked long enough. If they were cooked an extra thirty seconds to a minute, it would taste much better in my opinion. The texture of the burgers are very similar to the microwaveable version, that is one thing that makes me not think it's that great. Their fries were pretty good, as well as their chicken rings, and that's what brings it up a little for me. The location isn't the greatest, but it isn't too far away from things where you have to go so far out of your way for it. It is a bit pricy in my opinion for the amount of food that you get, but what do you expect, it's the only White Castle on the west coast. It definitely is worth the experience, but not much more than that to me."
vT0IbhRS5i3pkEXGpUnwjw,It has been about 20 years since going after Cubs games. Now they are in LasVegas on the strip. So walked over during lunch ordered a number 1 4 original sliders fries and a med drink. Yep it was delicious.
Sk2XoQUk-YquSSQwxAfSng,"Yummie drunk folks food! I got a 4 pc cheeseburger combo and added a slider. It was served fresh and hot!  I really enjoyed my meal here with a tingly refreshing cherry coke.

It was pretty busy but the line moved quickly!"
VUnSQbUDK6249Ma0VWcbNA,Don't know what the big deal is. Meat in the burger thin and small.  Tastes ok for me. Given the hype when it was opened expected something better.
r8owgHerb2jTjLwnpQT_Dg,"Pretty alright place they have!

Very confusing location. Got two crave cases & some chicken rings (or something idk they had chicken onion ring shaped patties) 

I thought I'd have to wait hours in line. 

When I walked it I was immediately helped. In & out within 4 minutes!

The staff seemed a little rushed but I give them credit. It got way busy after I left. 

The chicken sandwiches I got were so good. I am certainly going back for more very soon! 

Thank you White Castle. You guys did a good job!"
ItTRZ-NHWXO7lFREs_lDJw,"The worst burger place I've ever been to. All the burgers have NO sauce. The cashier, Savana, a SUPERVISOR by the way, almost bit my nose off when I ordered. Ronesha, the girl who calls the orders, looked like she drunk a bottle of vinegar. No smile, no thank you, no enjoy your meal, nothing, only bitchy face. I have to say that the security  and the cleaning people were SUPERfriendly. In other words, a big NO NO."
MbeWvio1UdovqHRI-rtRaA,"The smallest Burger I ever have. It looks cute, but taste was below average, but it only cost 1.29, what can I complain, pay what u get."
8RvZgEJM2ucLVrj2QYTYmQ,"D. Freakin'. Licious. Best drunk food ever. My husband and I stayed at the Venetian and we ate here 3-4 times (we weren't drunk each time lol) during our 2 night 3 day stay. I'm not proud to admit that. Only qualm is that the line one time was ridiculously long and they only had one register. But what made up for it was the customer service. John, the cashier, was super nice. FYI they do offer military discounts."
LI6AYl4KJ-s3ngR6rAmZdQ,"First time eating legit White Castle burgers and it didn't disappoint. Them sliders can be filling (I had 4 of them and i was full)...best part is, they are open 24/7!!! Now that's convenient!! So your missing out if you haven't had White Castle."
7KANX2DsOkdCKb_Ho6wGTw,"I believe White Castle is slightly over-rated based on the movie ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle."" Although I do have to say it's a lot better than McDonalds. The food is cheap and the service is quick. The staff at this White Castle had a great attitude and we're very friendly. 

This was my first experience at White Castle. I ordered a breakfast slider which was egg and cheese and your choice of meat. Although I did enjoy my meal it didn't live up to my expectation. 

Everyone should try White Castle at least once in my opinion. So if you happen to pass it I do recommend stopping for at least one of their sliders. It's worth the experience."
lXJgJlnRahzySnqo2WAiqA,"My review in one word... YUCK! 

I was so excited to try these little sliders, so my husband, our friend and I decided to go and we ordered their 20 slider combo. My husband is a picky eater so we ordered 15 with everything and 5 without onions or pickles. After waiting like 15 minutes for our order of course all 20 sliders had onions and pickles, so we had to order 5 more. Like I said... Yuck!! We were hungry as hello so I ended up eating 5, our friend 7 and my husband 4, we threw the rest away!! :( 

I guess these are popular in the East Coast because they don't have In-n-Out!!"
TWTMAlV3nwlnRY-DCbEiyQ,White Castle in Vegas on the strip next to Harrah's ok it's an ok place I'm not a big fan of White Castle but when you're hungry it tastes better lol. it's a small area but they are pretty fast. not much places to sit down especially when crowded. Prices are pretty high too but what do you expect for Las Vegas and on the Strip where they raise prices up. I think once to experience was good enough for me I'll stick to Lobster Me or D'Amores Pizza in PH or Secret Pizza in Cosmo for a fast lunch.
flAAoquBQ2fW0WKFErylYg,"This place is more hype than anything. I got one of each of the burgers and they were all disappointing. Same as the microwaveable crap you buy at the grocery store minus the long ass line. Save your money and time, go to a grocery store, or skip it entirely and get yourself a habit burger, hell, even McDonald's taste better than these tiny crap burgers. Two stars because I did like the loaded fries. PS I was not drunk, had I been, I'd probably think they were the best damn burgers in town."
Rw6GaVgvEO-f4yhvNU42Vg,I was super excited to see a White Castle in Las Vegas. Food was hot and made exactly how I ordered. *I wish you had the sack of fries like other locations have. They had enough employees to handle the crowd of customers.
JyldUeGKInAL9fy5pA1R5Q,"Well well well i realize its opening day and it went pretty well for a 2 1/2 hour wait in line and 33 mins to get our food.... All was hood except the smokers who didnt care and at the very end of what could have been at least 4 stars... Riley at the door was belligerent to me when i came back in to get my daughter who was waiting on the food.... Too bad with the prices SO high, the novelty is a 80 cent burger they are 1.59 with cheese. Really guys? You wont make enough? This is a great way to run off your locals, trust me, youll regret it!"
6XD9WLLzSD5X0EJpHXogdA,Great experience!! The burgers were DELICIOUS! The customer service was fantastic and the staff was extremely friendly! I will definitely be back!! So excited that this restaurant finally moved to the west coast!
v4RTBKHUKtu_uR2_nXBUWg,"The service was pretty quick. We ordered the 20 pack with 2 fries. The bottom buns were soggy----otherwise, the burgers were pretty good. Would come again if in the area."
1FxVD9JjmcKzEiWsXBd2ww,"Grew up in Chicago and always loved sliders! This is more of a white castle ""light"" location meaning, they have a limited menu. However, for me the double cheeseburgers were awesome! They nailed it! Onion chips (think cut up rings) were very good as well.
Negatives were the smaller menu (would love some jalapeno burgers), location is not the best, gets a bit crowded/long lines, over priced for sure, and the fries, meh, still not very good.
Still, living in Phoenix now, I am thrilled I can get great sliders without having to fly back to Chi-town - I would definitely hit this place every time I was in town."
QzZwycBSkmzpclaKWGUiUQ,"had never been... not worth the walk! it was a fun experience since it's one of those places made famous by the movies, but not something I could imagine ever craving."
yqjf0urUYebmpP6ypzi7rA,"Went today around 3:30 and was only in line for about 30 min. The employees were so nice, and didn't seem stressed at all considering the craziness they've gone through these past few days. They taste just like NY, brings back a lot of memories. The only downfall is the price, they range from $1.10-$1.50 each. NY is like half the price."
dn_mp9Mgxgn3Vsd5XpvR9A,Typical franchise location that created a ton of hype only to disappoint with frozen disgusting meat and a dirty and extremely crowded dining room.  The meat was just more like a thinly slice of roast beef that lacks flavor.
dSnXWFHWKcVl4Y8O0tkJzA,"After walking up and down the Strip twice I was craving some White Castle almost as much as Roldy and Kumar!

From the outside it looked like a tiny standalone but actually the location is inside the Casino Royale.

Got the #7 Castle Pack, which was 10 sliders, two regular fries and two drinks.

Service was good as they got my order out quickly in spite of the place being packed but for my first time eating White Castle burgers at a White Castle I was rather disappointed. 

These certainly did not hit the spot! I know sliders don't have much meat but these were practically meatless! And the onions could've tasted a whole lot better. The Fries were meh too as they were a bit soggy.

Not gonna lie, I enjoyed the microwave White Castle burgers you get from the grocery better..."
dG1hQDpGdHgNHQoyJ8lTkg,"Being from the East Coast and now living on the Left Coast, there are some foods I just can't get. This being one of them. Prices seemed a big higher than usual, probably the Vegas tax The service was quick and the food just as I remembered. First time I've seen one of those fill up beer from the bottom machines, pretty interesting. I'm good with White Castle for at least another year!"
wJhS2g1ZfFKvHQGx9CG0sA,"Just like the ones in Michigan. Steamed onions, patties and buns. Must get the ketchup mustard mix."
U7GR5Y5-zik3zF7VykXelA,Kids liked their White Castle experience taste just like the frozen ones. Try adding the new jalapeño cheese really good especially on the fish burgers. Long lines but employees are very friendly and efficient.
RYwcghMWZTIUKIqFz_FHFg,"White Castle on the west coast?

HELL YES...

My Harold and Kumar dreams have come true!

Located across from The Mirage, between Casino Royale and The Venetian. 

Now expectations wise don't be amazed. Yeah it's good. Pay $1.39 for a 2 bite burger isn't exactly the bang for buck but it's unique and it has a history..and a movie after it!

Make sure you get cheese. My east coast fam flamed me for ordering a crave case (30) pack of original.. so don't make the same mistake.

Quite frankly it adds up to $15 or so bucks to get decently satisfied if you're a moderate eater. It'll hold up in Vegas fine. Quick service, surprisingly nice workers and decent burgers.

So go get wasted or high or both , have an epic journey throughout the Vegas strip, stop by here and earn your H&K moment."
fA7kfwtkpmrJcc7rduU4OQ,"It's... fine.  I'm not really sure what I was expecting, but this has been a questionable item on my bucket list since the first Harold and Kumar movie.  Being a west coast girl, this was adventurous fast food cuisine for me.  Turns out the hamburgers taste pretty much exactly like the microwaved versions you buy in the grocery store.  The chicken rings taste a bit like breaded shoe leather, definitely don't bother ordering those.

There can be a a significant wait to get your order, and the dining area is suffused with a quiet, desperate sadness, so if there are no available tables, go get (a lot) of drinks elsewhere and try again later."
pla0yY7hNIsOmD20a7iNFA,"Thank you White Castle for coming to the WEST COAST.... As soon as they opened in Las Vegas, I was there that week. Can you bring one to CALI please, if not will travel for food."
ptg4kx2BVSVp6WmqMawaIw,"TBH I only wanted to try this place out because of Harold & Kumar. Lol 

Since they opened this location in Vegas, I decided to try this place out.

Location: This place is located on the strip near the Palazzo Hotel and right next to Walgreens. It's right across the street from The Mirage and Treasure Island. 

Parking: You're gonna have to park at a nearby hotel and walk over if you aren't already staying at them because it is located directly on the strip.

Menu: Pretty straight forward. Original or Cheese Sliders. They serve beer on tap! How awesome is that?! Lol You can also buy meal packages, sets of 30, 100 lol

Boyfriend and I opted for 10 cheese sliders and 5 original to compare and we heard they were small. 

** TIP- You will not like these sliders if you do not like onions. I only like onions if they're cooked or caramelized or depending on my mood. I know I'm weird. Lol

I had low expectations going into this place despite reading other reviews. The cheese sliders wasn't too bad. I would eat it again. The cheese was so gooey and blended well with the onions and meat party. The original one was just too plain. The cheese definitely makes it taste 10x better. I don't recommend the original ones at all. The also come in cute little boxes. 

This place would definitely be great drunk food lol but it's not amazing but it's not bad either! I just can't see myself craving it all the time. 

Check this place out at least once so you can say you tried it!"
G-AFoWkZjpa3BxyROU4hyA,"After all those days of feasting on frozen white castle burgers... I finally tried it for real... and the disappointment was real...

My friend and I were ambition as hell and ordered the 30-pack of cheeseburgers.... after our lunch which was no more than 2 hours prior. That was about 2250 calories for each of us... (A package of 2 frozen ones is like 300 calories). We took our first bites and continued to much due to excitement... but the flavor sunk in. Wait, scratch that, what flavor? Compared to their frozen counterparts, these lacked salt, umami, msg, etc etc. Not satisfying at all... we left defeated."
5yUvEwavFVwpfnyfafJi_w,"I dont get it....sorry. Tasteless little nuggets of some kinda meat, and fries that are no better than Del Taco. Service was friendly and quick and she asked if I were a local (which I am) so she gave me a little discount. Not sure what the appeal is but I'd pass on by next time. Even in a drunken hunger this place didn't satisfy."
DVfqAbvnK9yfMkf8xFHpkw,"It's just okay. Neither good nor bad. I wasn't expecting much coming here but it was worth a try. Lines can be long but once you order the food it comes out pretty fast. 

The sliders were nothing to rave about... Super simple- patty, pickles (gross) & onions.  My favorite thing here were probably the onion chips. (Similar to onion rings but smaller pieces) Their chicken rings reminds me of Burger King's chicken fries.  

I'd honestly need at least 3 or 4 sliders to fill up.  The menu only shows the combo prices. Sliders are $1.59 each. 

If you want something different than your usual fast food joint then this place may be it. I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  MEHHH."
Wap4jWEuPsCOcxlCT8AqIg,"Great first time and I'm digging the sliders so hard. 

I've wanted to try White Castle for a while but I'm unsure of where one is in my area. Finally got my chance to and I don't regret it. The prices of the sliders were delightful and affordable. Quality isn't top notch but I feel like it's more enjoyable than a McDonald's burger. And it simply melts in your mouth, it was great, I didn't know that a slider could run like gold down your throat. 

I was also really big on the free onion ring slices that came with the sliders. That was amazing! I didn't even ask for that and there they were! I think that's a thing? Am I wrong? Or did the server just love me that much? I'd like to think it's both. Yeah probably both. 

While I loved the flavor of what I ate, White Castle is definitely more of a late night snack than a stomach bloating meal. For me at least.  But I loved it none the less."
Gr7sRHInl-JC-Xj0DfHFKw,Good burgers for a reasonable price... Eat here to save money while on the strip!
rlh_Sk5croW4D1Mqu9CzRg,"Okay, so this place is more like 3.75 stars but whatever.  I'm gonna give them a four despite hearing all of Yelp scorning me on my check-in ( :P ).  Hey, we don't have a White Castle in Arizona and I have wanted to try an actual White Castle forever.  Even before I saw Harold & Kumar, I enjoyed their frozen sliders growing up.  Eating the real deal after all this time, even after a great German lunch, was heaven.  It could also be because I was under-dressed for the surprisingly cold Vegas weather but the warmth of a cheese slider was bliss.  I loved every dang bite and I don't care what y'all say.

We ordered a 10-slider, fries, onion rings, and two drinks combo.  We got five regular hamburgers and five cheeseburgers just to see the difference.  I was trying to tell Mike W. that cheese makes everything better but he didn't listen and I ended up having to choke down some plain burgers while he enjoyed my delicious cheeseburgers.  The fries were meh but those onion rings were pretty legit.  

All in all, I wouldn't mind stopping in for a quick cheap bite when I'm on The Strip.  Is it the best burger ever?  Haha, of course not.  This is a fast food place, obvi.  But I definitely wouldn't say no to going over to White Castle for a quick bite!"
kHnKMZiC-IgBGhbcUSPmzg,"There isn't a White Castle in the DC metro area, so I definitely had to visit when I was in Vegas. 

The sliders didn't look appetizing but tasted decent. This is definitely an establishment to visit after having a long night at the bars.

Next time, I'll take advantage of the close proximity of In N Out instead. At least they have top quality burgers for a better price."
cP1A1KjNkIZAPyEBWnkfpg,"White Castle!!!!

I was so excited to see that a White Castle had opened up in Vegas.  I have been wanting to try it ever since Harold and Kumar.  I already knew going in that I was probably not going to be blown away by White castle.  I had tried the microwavable ones and they were okay.  It is fast food and sliders, so I was not expecting gourmet or even In N Out status.  I was just excited to try it just for the sake of saying I had it before.  

It is open 24 hours and located inside the Casino Royale.  We were staying at the Venetian which was just a short walk away.  The line was pretty long when we got there but it moved pretty quickly.  Their menu mostly concentrates on their sliders and they have a few slider combinations that you can get.  We decided on 10 sliders with cheese and a side of onion slices.  Each slider comes in a square box and has chopped onions and a pickle inside.  We got our order pretty quickly and headed back to the Venetian to enjoy our food.  The people working there are really nice and good natured.  They were having fun at their jobs and our cashier had a good personality.  

I read a lot of people complaining about the size and relative price of the burgers.  It is a slider, that is what they are known for and it is fast food AND it is Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is like a dollar or so more in pricing when compared to another city where tourism is not so heavily relied upon.  Seriously though, lower your expectations a bit beforehand and you should be good. 

Despite thier small size, those things pack quite a punch because of the buns.  I got full after eating about 4 of them.  The first one I ate, I thought was really good.  The onions, cheddar cheese, soft bun and thin patty came together perfectly.  I did not even mind the pickle in there and I usually hate pickles.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first one.  By the third and fourth one, I was enjoying then less and less.  If you have had the microwavable ones, then you have pretty much tasted what they taste like.  They taste exactly like the microwavable boxed ones except just a tiny bit better.  The onion chips were really good.  I would definately recommend that if you like onions.  The breading is crunchy and thick.  We ended up having two sliders left over and I ate one at like 5 am when we got back from the club.  Still pretty good, but the bun got really hard.  

I enjoyed my sliders but then again I came in with low expectations.  If you are not from the midwest or east coast and you just happen to be in Vegas, I would definately give it a shot.  It is open 24 hours anyways.  I do not think I would crave them but I would get it again if it were convenient."
xYmddD9LEtZSoPK0x7u52w,"Been wanting to try this place since everyone keeps talking about it. Came on the day of Christmas and it was packed but we managed to get a table and came before the rush. Ordered the fish slider, chicken slider, and the regular beef slider. The sliders were good but the portion were so tiny compared to photos..I enjoyed it but it was gone before I knew it..took like 3 bites and it's gone. I wish the patty was slightly bigger, it was quite thin I almost missed it. The fish slider was delicious and super soft. The chicken slider was probably best out of all 3 for me. Please increase your portion!"
r4wO4kez94h-dilxNMgJ6w,"They are considered a east coast institution but they tasted like McDonalds Cheeseburgers to me. I think its the combination of pickles and onions and thin meat on a soft bun.

Would I try again, why not but I wouldn't expect outstanding at all. 

Onion strips were okay. Staff was polite and kind and had me on my way with combo #2 in no time (4 cheeseburgers, onions or fries plus drink).

Place is located on the east wall of the Casino Royale which I think they took some space from a Denny's that use to be there or might still be there. 

Security is there to keep people from cutting a very long line.

My experience was walking in and was asked by a guard if I just got there, I said yes and then he asked me to get in line but there was no long line, I asked him which line? He then said oh, another guard just said go ahead sir. Line was actually 5 deep at the time and not out the door to the strip like some mentioned."
xm66UOKtz2ve7eqvGZEgEQ,"Charlton & the gang go to White Castle! Since this Vegas trip was primarily focused on burgers I wanted to experience as many places as possible. Ever since the movie Harold & Kumar go to White Castle popularized the existence of this burger chain to a wider audience, it has always been on the back of my mind to try it. Unfortunately since they are only located in the Midwestern United States, I had to settle on the frozen ones that they sell and love it or hate it, I find them quite tasty! 

Las Vegas is known for housing popular ""guilty pleasure"" restaurants that can't be found outside of their respective regions or cities, making them must-visit destinations for tourists. Casinos have opened such iconic locations as Pink's Hot Dogs from Los Angeles in the Planet Hollywood Casino, and New York City's Shake Shack recently found a home inside the New York, New York Casino.

This White Castle is located across the street from the Mirage. You can easily walk to this location by parking either at the Ceaser's Palace self parking or at any other of the casinos close by and walk to it. The location is small but there is plenty of seating available inside. Since I've had the frozen ones plenty of times before, I wanted to order the exact ones which were the cheeseburger sliders. The lowest combo you can get is 4 sliders with fries and a drink which is what I decided to get (having still been fairly full from the buffet from earlier). 

Once you place your order, you get a number to wait; thankfully orders are pushed out quick since they are made en masse. The sliders are all packaged individually; I can only imagine how many they go through a day. Taking my first bite, it instantly reminded me of the frozen ones. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. The only difference was that there are pickles in the sliders that are not in the frozen ones. It does add more flavor to it but not much else. These sliders go quick, I can usually finish one in two bites or one if I really want to. The fries are crinkle cut, my personal favorite, they aren't as good as Del Taco's or Shake Shack's fries but it gets the job done. 

I would suggest coming here if you have NEVER eaten the frozen ones before. Then you can brag to all your friends who live out in the west or east coast saying that you've actually been to an actually White Castle. This place is worth coming for a late night snack, drunk food or a quick meal. Otherwise, if you have had the frozen ones before then you are really not missing out on anything other than the pickle. 

I am a fan of White Castle sliders but I'll settle for the frozen ones just fine. 

CC out!"
NP5EwpyxyaM34Hr8-6gaSA,"I've been to Krystal burger several times, so was excited to finally be able to compare them to White Castle (never having the opportunity to try White Castle except for frozen version). I think it hits the spot if you're drunk. And the buns are more fluffy than their frozen counterparts when fresh. So overall it's worth a go to see what Harold and Kumar were all about. Like it or hate it, it's cool that it exists on the west coast now."
67PS-6n8Ol5oU9k-Z1z7xA,"So to start off I'm not a burger fanatic i rarely eat them and if I do its a couple of bites from my son or BF. 

What we ordered was the cheese burger slider which came with 4 cheeseburgers a regular fries and a drink. The sliders had pickles cheese and onions. It was soft and good. But if youre a big burger eater i suggest you order their crave packs that have 10 or more depending on how hungry you are. The buns were soft meat was soft too kinda reminds me of a meatloaf in a way but a good meatloaf lol. 
We also ordered the onion ring chicken slders it came two sliders regular fries and a drink. The chicken sliders were good it reminded me burger kinds chicken fries. The other stuff we ordered on the side was onion chips theyre like onion rings but turned into bite size pieces of goodness. We also had the bacon ranch fries theyre crinkled cut fries loaded with bacon ranch and cheese. It was pretty good. The other thing I ordered was a vanilla shake it was thick and yummy. Above all I would come bk the lines are long but once you order your food comes out pretty fast. They have an assembly line going on in front of you so you can see what theyre doing to your food. The best part is it's open 24 hours 7 days a week. The location is in between Venetian and Harrahs inside the Casino Royale. Oh yeah they also serve beer for all you beer lovers :-)"
IuPuyWbtB1ZJyHegj_KwJQ,First time ever at a White Castle.  Had to see what all the hype was about.  Quick fast food.  Tasty little sliders especially after a night of Vegas drinking.
RdTb8fNTu8rM10KcXLX1Pg,"Harold & Kumar does not justify White Castle. the hype is ridiculous. Or Vegas White Castle is not as tasteful as expected. What an unfortunate turn of events. At least we gave it a shot. 

if you want what I encountered at White Castle then head to your nearest grocery store & purchase the frozen pack. That's all."
w9Tm-W2Lk1lVFLp_HWPxhA,"It's OK.  Nothing special. But I would get the novelty of this place because it was on the movie ""Harold and Kumar"" Lol. Burgers are $1.99 and 4 pack combos are around $7.99 not bad. For a quick late night snack it's definitely a good place to go if nothing is open."
QRbpuwxfC5Ls_xHD3Xmzjw,"I'd say this is a good experience for those who've heard the legend of White Castle (much like how East Coasters need to try In N Out, us West Coasters need to try White Castle) and only have tasted the retail supermarket frozen freezer version of these mini silders.

I was actually fairly excited at the prospect of trying the White Castle Burger.

They sell them individually and they're over $1 each.  If you look at the special ""dollar menu"" items at rival fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, Wendy's etc. and take a step back and analyze how much food you get in a White Castle Burger vs a full sized burger, it doesn't add up 'tho.  It takes at least 4 White Castle Burgers to equal a standard burger (not even a Whopper or a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, Jumbo Jack or Happy Star).

So, to that degree, I think the mini-burgers are worth at most $0.50 each and ideally, not to be thrifty sounding, but in analyzing pound for pound and bang for the buck comparisons to their peers, maybe 3 for $1 or 4 for $1, so about $0.25 each (they did debut after all for $0.05, a nickle each, albeit back in the 1920's nearly a century ago.

Beyond the pricing, the food was unique, it has a soft steamed bun with a pickle and chopped cooked onions with a very thin and sort of slimy (not in a bad way) square (a la Wendy's) beef patty which is reminiscent of those Banquet/Swanson's frozen dinner ""Salisbury steak"" or sliced meatloaf.

It's quite tasty and I like 'em where others may feel they're stoner late night snacks, I can see eating 'em and easily going through 4 and possibly eating 10 and maybe even being up to the challenge of over indulging to potentially eat 20... and those statements are both a testament to the fact they do taste good, but they're also not so filling and very small in size.

The french fries are really weak 'tho, previously frozen crinkle cut, very thin, small portions.  I'd roll the money to be spent on fries towards other food purchases.  Del Taco uses similar styled fries, but they're much better in pricing, portions and execution (fried nice and fluffy inside and crispy outside).

I rate this * * * three stars, ""A OKAY"" which means I'd recommend it and come back again, but it's not necessarily so unique that I'd crave it and put it on my ""must go to"" list whenever in the area, which is in part my criteria for my rankings of places that earn four or five stars.

This location is on the Vegas Strip in a very safe area, easy to park if you park in a hotel casino I'm sure, congested to get to by car via the Las Vegas main strip, but convenient if you're staying in a local hotel."
5Xb96BV7dJNIPkvD-h4S2A,The food is addicting.  The little burgers are cute and perfect for the little ones and as for my son awesome for all his food challenges. Every time we are in Vegas we have to stop by white castle. . Decent price . The only down fall is the parking area is not accessible. The other down fall is there is never a place to sit so the kids wait for a place to open to save seats while we order.
dQki36rW5CiHos_WMO5iDQ,"Waited in line for about an hour and a half but it was worth it. We ordered 20 burgers added cheese to half of them and it came with 2 Fries. Also added a 6 pc chicken rings and soda and total came out to $37!  The fries were nothing special and I won't get them again and the chicken rings were alright. Nothing special either. Burgers of course were delicious and we took half of them home and warmed the rest up for dinner. Only complaint is the prices!! They should be charging the same that they do at all there east coast locations not jacking the price up cause it's on the strip. Hope they get the jalapeño burgers soon cause those are the best!

I also like to say it cracks me up how people
Compare this to in n out!!! There is no comparison what so ever so stop comparing. There's actually not a single fast food or burger joint U can compare to White Castle."
Zpi39i788KZKTAEf5jlEEg,do not eat if your diet lately has been healthy. your stomach gonna hurt real bad. other then that classic drunk food. mini burgers fries and a cherry coke.
jA0LQt2dCysuHbpnqMfJbQ,"Wanted to try this place since forever, there wasn't much of a line and the orders came out quick, my daughter is a chicken nugget queen so we got lucky and ordered the chicken rings which were small so you gotta order the 9 piece. We tried both the cheese sliders and original, I think without cheese they have a better flavor. Love it!"
GYuAb3cjdVQ0uJPuurohfg,"Had to try it!
I was more about the experience than the food I think!
paper thin burgers with 5 holes in the middle.
Great Mustard
Fries were good
Very long line, Friday nigh about 40 minutes in line and no lots of seating."
28krQn6BW3Bz3QPGfEGsPg,"OMG!  There is a White Castle now in Vegas!?!?  Why??

Guess it's for the dudes that did not score...

I grew up in the East Coast surrounded by White Castle's.

Basically it's a gross hamburger that ONLY tastes great when it is between 2 AM and 5 AM and you meet ALL THREE of the following conditions:

1. Your are drunk, and 
2.  You are very hungry, and
3.  You did not score at the club.  

My friends and I would come to White Castle in HIGH SCHOOL after a night of cruising, boozing (fyi: drinking age was 18 back East--16 if you looked older and cool), schmoozing, and losing. 

At 2 AM all night long the place is filled with dudes that have no squeeze box--otherwise they would not be here--you have loser spelled all over you when you step foot in the door.  

But after a few White Castles at 25 cents each, 30 cents with cheese it was, and some greasy ass fries--you don't worry about it till the next morning when you wake up alone with Hamburger breath. 

Not a place for children, not for the sober, not for anyone looking for a quality hamburger, not a place you take a significant other or any woman unless you want to get dumped fast.  

I still have vivid memories of the those days back at WC. If I could only go back in time, I would not have needed to make as many trips there with the boys."
9_WXA9uHkcoW-skJTNEEFA,"Been eating white castle since I lived in chitown, they're a little pricy, but there def worth the wait.....HEY its Vegas so expect to pay more..."
Op7kSM8HCG1hmrazz7_z6g,"Next time you see the line and ask yourself ""is it worth it?"" 
ANSWER- NO!!!!! 

Great food.. Terrible service. I get that it's a Friday night and you are understaff but to treat your customers with disrespect and roll your eyes when you serve them their food is just degrading. It's not that hard to make 20 sliders for someone. Especially after you already made 20+ for someone who ordered after. 

""Here's your order (as she slaps the bag on the counter)"" -staff 
Just rude.
Ps. 40 min after we orders 

Been there, done that, never going to do it (in vegas) again."
0r3xcuMso8OQUNhB3_wjMg,"Not sure how you managed to screw up a Chicago institution... but you did. 

I have been going to white castle since I was little in Chicago. Cheap, hot, tasty little meat treats. The highlight was the warm juicy onions against that little crunch of pickle. 

The location in vegas has just missed the boat. They were tastless, over salted and soggy. I was so ticked I went to the manager and said these are not white castles. He asked me where I was from, told him, he laughed and said me too, then he went back there and made me some himself. Those tasted right. 

Ultimatly I think it is the fact that you have non-chicagoans trying to make vintage Chicago food. It would be like having a blind guy pick your wardrobe... he can get close because someone told him about the colors but never dead on because having never experiance them, he doesn't  really know what the colors are. (No that's not a dig on blind people). Same deal here..."
w2oiv7Iq9M2tvImPbSL_Ag,"Honetly I came here at 3 in the morning (its a 24 hour location) and the line was ridiculous. Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting. 

It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad. 

On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious."
7eNi69fHyw0vAey4_3VOAA,"Great place for a late night snack after a party hardy night on the Strip. Space is a bit cramped but food is up to par. Service was fairly quick, got our ""Sack"" of 10 sliders within 10 minutes."
h7x1qALxufRDYNF9-6PB8Q,I finally got my white castle burgers and the wait was worth.  Would have given 5 starts but the fries were not good.  So So good.  Wish I would have gotten 6 instead of 4.
bA7WMEz0P6vvANzwW7Ilzw,"DEAR Las Vegas,

White Castle is the bomb.  YES you need to be drunk.  YES you want to get them ""extra steamed"".  And ask management... Where is the dusseldorf and big red??????

What is a slider? A SMALL DAMN BURGER!

PS.  White castle is the 1st ever burger shop.  It has been around since 1921. 
PPS.  If the only reason you are coming here is because of Harold and Kumar, GO HOME.  That's like only enjoying Friends in Low Places at a Garth Brook concert."
c2isJ9Y5XYoqcdHQQ0m81g,"Heard the menu selection in Chicago is bigger and offers Jalepeno burger.
Burgers are not very much different from the Frozen White Castle in your local stores."
B1s9llQKEjguk1s4M6kE6A,"We parked at Venetian and walked over. Found out there was a White Castle in Vegas and had to go. We stopped by after a show at the Mandalay at around 1am. 

Great place to go for a late late night snack....if you're wasted. This is totally drunk food. Don't come here if you're sober. The meat was thin and flavorless. It resembled Spam. Service was super quick though. Fries were the best part of the meal. I would love to try White Castle again...but not in Vegas."
g2msMIdgpi6OxvU8jbROpw,"Oh White Castle! Even though I never watched the Harold and Kumar movie before, I have heard about the sliders from White Castle and I couldn't wait to try one. Luckily, this fast food restaurant was open 24/7 so after a night of clubbing, my friend and I headed over to this place for a quick meal. There was definitely no lines on a Tuesday morning around 4am, and I quickly ordered one original slider ($1.29) and one chicken ring slider ($1.99) to try. The cashier proudly told me he had 15 chicken rings for lunch when I seemed hesitant in trying the chicken ring slider. I was definitely not hungry enough for 15 chicken sliders, but you do you boo. However, props to the cashier working on this 4am shift! 

When I received my sliders, I was quite surprised at how tiny these sliders looked. They were about the size of my palms and I'm pretty sure I can eat the slider in one bite if I tried hard enough. Taste wise- they were both okay. They were not mind-blowing and I don't see myself craving these sliders in the future. They actually tasted a bit plain to me, since there was no special sauce included in the beef or chicken slider. I guess this a good place to grab a quick bite if you are on a budget since the prices were more reasonable than other restaurants on the strip. I can't say I won't ever be back, but probably not in the near future."
v7PheqsQlyrSFzeF0j2oPw,"I've only heard of the wonders that are White Castle sliders. As a CA native, WC is a thing of movies and the frozen aisle at Walmart, but I needed to try the real thing. The line was short on a Sunday at 11am and my double cheese slider was ready in less than 5 minutes. IT WAS ALL I EVER HOPED AND DREAMED OF. The onion content is a bit heavier than I'd have chosen, but I'll know that for next time. Hot, moist, delicious, and satisfying. Why aren't these available closer to home?"
ZZ3_LtBQyHRRkyV0EpOixw,"Yay. First time trying and I was not disappointed. 

SIMPLE Cheeseburgers & Cheap! 
Extra grilled onions 
Liked the open kitchen layout.
Super Clean!
Friendly staff."
Y64IXgRBNbwxJu80yLcuKw,"Are you in Las Vegas in the north part of the strip, drunk, hungry, wandering around, already took off your heels and have flat/slippers/or just nastily barefoot? White Castle is there for you! I mean, it is what it is! If you think chicken nuggets are unnaturally shaped, get on some chicken RINGS! I cannot differentiate between regular White Castle burgers from the brick & mortar and the frozen ones. It's like they might as well have a bunch of microwaves to warm up the frozen mutant meat--no one is going to notice or care.

Chicken Rings, wtf? Yes."
6uA6mhXA8dCaW8_QB1TEkQ,"It was husbands pick.  Heard about the lines on opening day so I was worried that it might be crowded but alas it was not at all and I can see why.  It is connected to the Casino Royale but has its own store front so you literally pass it when walking on the strip.  You can see and hear slots in the dining room.   I've tried them in the frozen aisle before and ended up tossing the rest of the box because I thought they were awful then.  I was hoping that maybe getting it fresh would make a difference.  UM, no.  They were pretty awful.  Patty is thin as paper with no flavor.  Bread is soft and soggy.  Price was also a lot for the quality you get.  $7.99 for 4 sliders, ordinary crinkle fries and a drink but it could be because they are on the strip.  Even my husband was not crazy about them either.  It was good enough to try once but I won't be coming back.  I just don't get the fascination?  Give me In and Out Burger anyday.  Heck even Burger King beats it and I can't stand Burger King.  They get an extra star for friendly staff. As for the complaint about the trays, that is the least of their problem.  The whole thing was so bland.  Would be good for kids."
Hv39syMOWdBRTRueX4OuIw,Food is whack....don't know what Harold and Kumar were craving...don't this crap here...In-N-Out rules here...
2XtRq7CFGcwsiCNSsEYtjA,"I love how all of these east coast classics are making their way to Las Vegas! I guess that is the one perk about living in a city that is just one big tourist destination.

White Castle made its debut a few months ago in Casino Royale, a hotel that is smashed between the Venetian and Harrah's. White Castle is really easy to find since their have their own entrance from the street. I have read the reviews about the long lines, so I waited out the hype and my first visit was last week. I was there around 4pm on a Sunday and the line was not too bad-- I would say tops, 15 minutes. 

We ordered four cheese sliders, a double slider, loaded fries, regular fries, cheese sticks, and drinks. The person took our order asked where we were visiting from and when replied that we lived here she offered us a 10% local discount. Sweet! You wait for your number to be called at the end of the counter. The food came out in about 5 minutes. 

Cheese Sliders-- They are pretty tiny, seeing how the meat in the burger is about the thickness of about 10 post it notes stacked on top of each other. But hey, they were still pretty tasty. I like the squishy buns. Ha, that sounds really weird.

Fries-- Crinkle fries are better than any other fries in the whole entire world. So, I like!

Loaded Fries-- Meh, could skip on these. The bacon and cheese toppings were not that special.

Cheese Sticks-- I think these things could be good if there was better marinara sauce. The sauce comes in one of those sauce tubs that do not require refrigeration. It has a weird after taste. 

After reading all of the mixed reviews, I have to say that my visit was better than expected. A lot of people are saying that it is not like how it is on the east coast, but that's how it usually goes. The original is always better. Don't even get me started on Shake Shack LV. All of our mini sliders & fries came out to be around $20-- but that was expected, since this is the strip. The next time I want to try the cheesecake on a stick or the chicken sliders. I think I saw a sign that said that they also have a breakfast menu.

Oh yeah, White Castle is open 24/7 to satisfy your after party munchies."
YtAY1ZJWV9Akwi6r5p6xwg,"So who was the wise guy that thought a whopping two registers was going to cut it? There's an army deep of prep workers and cooks in the back and periodically over a block long line of White Castle fans, with a team of security directing traffic and you only have TWO registers? Yeah, its awkward.

O T H E R W I S E...

Woohoo! White Castle is officially in Las Vegas! I can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but White Castle holds a special place in my tummy. I was born in Minnesota and still have family living there, so whenever I would visit, my uncle would welcome me to town with a crave case. What says love more than a giant box, shiny with grease, filled with sliders?

Of course, this is nowhere near the top ranked best fast food burger, but it wins in the nostalgia points! Mini sliders with grilled onions - you can't go wrong there -  portable, cute, easy to eat, and especially reminds me of my childhood. Their burgers taste like how I remember it, so they don't do a bad job at this Vegas location but consistency is questionable. On our second visit my sliders were all too soggy for my liking - which is not good, not good at all.

I actually prefer the original sliders over the cheese slider since the cheese overwhelms the flavor of the grilled onions too much and I love love LOVE the flavor of the grilled onions. Sometimes I would try to ask them for extra grilled onions and most of the time I am unsuccessful, but it's worth a try. 

We also dabbled in their cheese fries with ranch and bacon and the crew thought it was pretty tasty, but I think their crinkle cut fries need major work and typically taste stale. I really like their ranch sauce so I dip my sliders in it from time to time. Also pass on their onion chips, the batter is dense and not that great. Their shakes are simple, vanilla or chocolate - nothing crazy, but its not bad either. I don't think they offer a strawberry shake at this location since I would of been all over that. Oh yeah and they have brownies and cheesecake on a stick - just thought I'd let you know. 

I can typically eat 5 sliders on a good day and it is filling! For a normal person I think that 3-4 sliders is just right. For the overzealous types they also offer crave cases  and crates that range anywhere from 30-50-100! Dang. Don't come in here expecting an amazing burger - just great memories - KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS IN CHECK and I think you will be in a good place.

RIP stomach."
6Yh4drGp1kw-6NzXKHW6vA,"This was just freaking gros in my opinion, a couple of my friends liked it, for me the smell alone was enough for me to hurl. But as a foodie groupie such as myself lol, i don't let smell detour me its unfair. First off this place is constantly packed, fast service though. Price is a tad below average which is a small plus seeing its located on the strip. You might notice that the place is a dump in the inside, understandbly so many people. As for the burgers/sliders they were tiny and light and also tasteless nothing to write about but an after taste that stays in your mouth tasting like old onion. I went to use their toilets after waiting in line for 5 minutes, just as disgusting , it looks like the burgers rushed out of people's systems in a hurry. Save some gambling money eat somewhere better, this place is for the those in desperation to eat cheap."
VL1e9sfnhSEw05Wtoc6-jg,"The food was okay. The burgers were a little thin for me and needed some flavor-- I would get them with cheese, next time. But, I would give whom I think is the manager (we were there around 12 noon on June 1, 2015) the extra star for his skills, he was working hard along side his workers, kept his cool with his employees, and I don't know how he does it, but he even ran up to the front to call a customer back to ask if they needed condiments because he noticed that his employee forgot to ask them if they needed some."
D4hMEkqEEh7YNBfm2RirGw,Stopped off for these little tasty treats on the way to checking into our hotel. They were melt in your mouth delicious! Better eaten fresh and not cold. It's a definite must stop in whenever in vegas
oLjeR2NOoXQtAwcDFiYbGg,"Ugh... I'm being generous with that third star... but whatever.  I grew up on microwaved White Castles... and my first time having them in person... they're honestly not bad.  Better than the microwave version, but not by much.  That pickle they put on there is just right for the flavor.  They're nothing special though.  What gets me is that they're pretty pricey for what they are...

I wouldn't seek them out again, but, if I was walking the strip and had the munchies while walking by, I'd certainly grab em."
vrWJ-DUmBjdGoAoVs4MlvQ,Tastes just like the Midwest classic! Lots of seating and it's open all night! Definitely will hit the spot!
LuJ6-1KKHy5vUrpkeBQgag,"Thank heavens this has finally landed upon the Las Vegas strip (at least until it happens to finally be bestowed upon California) is all I can say!

Well ok maybe not everything.....I will admit at first it was a bit difficult to find (was across the street pretty much from Mirage and tucked inside the craziness that is the Harrah's portion of the strip), but once I did it brought me back to the days of my youth in Minnesota and damned if nostalgia didn't make this meal taste that much better..Oh yeah and I'm talking about the REAL White Castle and not the supermarket abomination!

So I just kept it simple and got a bag of sliders with cheese (no condiments needed at that's a bold statement from this guy). It was just as I remembered from the taste to the smile at the end. They are small in nature, but I don't feel like a fatty if I pound out 5 of them! I did like the fact they are put in paper containers now and the pickle in the middle gives it that perfect hint of umph when partnered with the tender meat and gooey cheese..Just thinking of the slider salivates the mouth indeed!

I did take notice that the line does get a bit lengthy, but doesn't that tell you your taste in food is better than most? I thought the staff managed to kill the line pretty fast so for me waiting wasn't a complaint at all. I also found that they treat you with respect if you give it back so my experience was just as I remembered it.

All in all, I will be back again and this time I just might bust for the 100 slider snack pack..Signed, sealed, and delivered their mine!"
Kum69ZC9ryApgRinsH8Xjw,"I gave into the hype. I just had to, even though reviews weren't great. Well, shocker, White Castle wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Burgers are basic but just really taste like bread. Fries were plain jane. No ranch dressing available to dip any of this in to make it better! 

Now I can say I've been to White Castle, an I definitely don't have to go again!"
WyAhHwYfesEsHfn4a7gvgA,"Being a California guy I've always wanted to try White Castle (yes cause of Harold and Kumar) these burgers are crap, nothing special about them, fries were barely decent"
ZOfYKek4Rr_mZetavQy7kQ,I Love White Castle burgers I waited 45 min because they just open in Vegas and I had 6 of them and they brought back memories back from my New York days.
yktezVHE5LuOetYJb4WGKA,"Three stars here because I love White Castle but not at the prices that exist at this location. I grew up in Ohio so White Castle was always around. It was a very cheap and fast way. Here in Vegas however, prices are doubled which quickly makes this place not worth going to. I love White Castle but not $10+ much."
VyBso3_xDJJV1apIU_XQCQ,"Must be a nostalgia thing. The wife always wanted to try one as she had family who loved these. Neither one of us can figure what the draw is. Not real burger tasting or anything to make it stand out. If you just want to say you had one then give it a go, at least it's not real pricey."
AT9VF34lhLFHDjZ-yhL51A,"Hell yes! That's all I said when I Jumped in line, growing up with a New Yorker in the house you learn a thing or two about the east, one thing I leave was WC! Growing up he always said the freezer boxes weren't the same.. I didn't understand till my first time in his hometown, the greatest experience ever! 
Came to Vegas for my Bday and relieved a Childhood memory of a deprived west coast child, bitter sweet coming without pops but I know he's looking down smiling because I ordered the same way he used to! The service was Great! The line was Short the fries fell short on taste but that's expected they aren't known for the fries not bad but not amazing.. The employees were great! Very involved! Over all a great experience this will be a go to spot for me every time I come to Vegas!"
PJTez3WxrAABnz3VWpnAnQ,"White Castle in NY is the best. When I visit that place is a must eat, a few times during visit we buy by the case. Well I live in henderson for 8 years. They were in silverton casino for the food truck fair. I waited in line for over an hour. They were worth waiting for. Cost 1.00 each. Today I went to the strip to get some. Very disappointed.   
The burgers were over cooked, no ketchup , no salt and the roll was like it was sitting unwrapped for hours. Dry and firm.Like a hamburger roll gets when left in sun.

In NY you are able to watch them make them. Seems like they are not making them the same way.  Corporate needs to bring out someone to train them and I don't  mean a manager. There was a lady in NY that was there for over 20 years. Food could be good but the chef has to cook it good......."
kes4L46Rrl7VnjoGjPMd8A,"WOW! So disappointing. Perhaps I was all about that Harold and Kumar hype but really...? Why did they travel far af to get these soggy ass sliders? 

Don't expect anything fabulous at White Castle. Pretty disappointing. It was rather expensive for 4 sliders & fries. The bun was really airy, could have been a good or bad thing depending on how you like dem buns. The patty was a sliver. Pretty sad.

The meal itself served its purpose of helping me hold my alcohol for the night soooo... 2 stars."
B0xRh8ICyTpCgmmn6WRZpw,"So, once I found out they opened a White Castle in Vegas, I knew I had to try it on my upcoming trip.  On our last night there, we took the Deuce down to Casino Royale (between Harrah's and the Venetian) to see what all the hype was all about.  I had heard the lines could get crazy, but luckily it was only minimally busy (Tuesday night) and the wait was short.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the hamburger.  :(   My sister-in-law tried the Chicken Ring burger and liked it, so I may consider trying that next time...  I'm glad I tried it, but not sure if I would go again."
FmPprK_FWNHU54h9VtkAOw,"First off, it's definitely not worth the 2 + hour wait. Wait like a month or so to go when the hype is over. My friend and I, being locals, drove from Henderson to the strip to try White Castle out. My family is from the east coast so I've experienced it before, but my friend hadn't. 
After our long wait, I ordered a combo with 4 sliders, a side, and a drink and I ordered the 10 slider pack to take back home to my grandma. My friend ordered 4 sliders, a side, and a drink. I received my order fairly quickly after ordering. 
I ate my food and waited an extra 30 minutes before my friend got his. I order 10 more sliders than he did. He went up 3 times to ask what was taking so long and the guy calling out orders said he had his ticket there and he would call him. Still nothing. He finally went and asked the cooks and they made his sliders right then and there. I don't see what the problem was. 
Also, two of my sliders had a pickle and two didn't. The fact that they are already inconsistent is pretty bad."
wjtzKsQoCv6q2VfEasqwNQ,2 stars cause the guy cleaning tables was quick and very friendly. Otherwise... This doesn't really taste like white castles from back home. Way soggy.
itjQ9gv4trM8tqTVVpA9ww,"Eh...not impressed and not worth the hype. Very little meat (almost paper thin), fries were dry, and more like ore ida frozen fries. Just really not impressed."
RZuu5WLHwi6BKiKkolyTbA,Late night munchies! Line was long and the security guards act like they're PD.... it's a white castle for God's sake... ! Oh yeah...get ready for some mean gas!  Fart game food. Most definitely a good time to play the fart game after eating at this place. Are the sliders on the east coast soggy because this place had the soggiest of the soggy.  Not a big fan. The microwave white castle burgers were way better and didn't give me the farts.
b6Yoq9Pnc5VU-Mnt_Dz5Nw,I hated it ! I'm from Chicago and I was excited about the idea more than the food. Onion chips WTF n was cold had to send back . Save the calories !! :-(
212i8WGVmmVwZ70Q0RHpvw,"I'm from New York where we could get these any time. When I moved here 15 years ago, I called corporate and inquired about opening a franchise out here. No go, All stores are corporate owned. Bought the boxed frozen White Castle's from Smiths for years. Finally was so excited they opened a store out here. Finally made time to go and check it out. Really? The burgers here don't even compare to the frozen boxed ones, and are not even in the same ball park of the traditional ones from NY. They tasted horrible! And in NY they never had pickles on them, where did that come from? In NY we jokingly called them belly bombs, out here they truly are! My stomach hurt for 2 days after eating this crap. I am truly disappointed here and will NEVER go back to this store. The boxed ones at Smiths are WAY better and closer to the real thing you get in NY."
Lf5V7zzSPFWnLXPlW9M0Fg,"My boyfriend & I have been waiting since our last Vegas trip for this to open!  Finally, a White Castle for us to try that is not frozen!  We ordered:

#7 - 10 original sliders (add cheese), 2 regular soft drinks, 2 regular French fries (one of them = cheese fries).  It sounds like a lot, but for 2 really hungry people, it is a cake to finish because the sliders are small.  Each slider comes with onions & pickles (I did not realize this until I took my first bite -__-)  The food is good & it is a perfect drunk meal for when you are finished clubbing because it open 24/7!
Fudge-dipped Cheesecake - Nothing extraordinary.

Customer service could have been better.  Several of us were looking at the menu & deciding & the cashiers kept on asking if we were ready.  Also, considering how much food my boyfriend & I ordered, they only gave us 3 ketchups...  My boyfriend went back to ask for more & the workers gave him 2, then I went back to ask for more & I got 3.  Pretty shady!"
kBGa0PeztC9q2raGdYX0QA,"Was just as I remembered growing join the Midwest, but the bread was soggy and the prices were a lot hugger. In Michigan, the current price is $4.99 for the number one. Here it's $7.99. I know it's located on the strip, but I was sooooo looking forward to coming here for an affordable meal. 

Also, the employees could at least smile! A smile goes a very long way! Making someone feel welcomed will keep them going back. With that and the prices I won't be in a rush to come back before I leave Vegas."
siiMbm0xWZDWpa6DPeR7ww,"Having lived primarily on the west coast, I have never had the opportunity to go to a White Castle. So whenever I went on a trip to the East Coast, I tried to make White Castle a must visit place. Unfortunately, it always eluded me, thus making the allure of White Castle that much greater. Even when it made its appearance at the food truck festivals, I opted not to wait in the 3 hour line. so when I heard they opened up a location on the strip, I figured I'd try it once and for all. And no, the Wal-Mart ones don't count. I also understand ones expectations usually does not meet their perception when yearning for so long. Plus I heard it's overrated. So when I tried it, I wasn't surprised it wouldn't live up to the hype. But what I didn't expect was for the frozen Wal-Mart ones to be better. That's right, I said it. I like my microwave sliders better. Maybe they rushed to get all orders out quickly, which is why my order felt on the cool side. i have to say though, I went on a Wednesday night and got my order quickly. So that's a plus right? So to end my review, I'll say it was ok. Worth the hype? Nah. Will I go back? Probably not. Vegas is surrounded by burger joints in the same price range. So I think I'll just check this off my list of places to try and move along."
ZfKxJdX-B4t4KWY0zql8OA,I once waited an hour for a seventh course meal and it was still faster than this.  Only reason I even attempted to wait this long is because I made myself believe that the bun was made of Egyptian papyrus scrolls and the meat was made of brontosaurus....
LeOHJIMLKjK9xhKGE3T2ig,"I preferred not to give any star at all! Taste nasty. the burger was wet,soft and it's like worst burger I ever had. Burger King's burger is way better than this shit. I don't know this place is so popular."
Vk8p1bGlfAT49ISrM5Nozw,"Not worth it. Go to in n out. Or any other burger joint if possible. The service was good but the food wasn't. Very bland, the pickle was the best part."
PNt-8O2bM9YBo9B0FAPdYw,"At least, I can chalk this one off the list! What were Harold and Kumar thinking?!? I was just expecting GREATNESS! The sliders were made with a thin soft bun with a small hamburger patty. I'm kind of a lettuce, tomato, and pickle on my burger gal so I found them to be plain for my taste, but not bad. The fries were good. I'd only go back if a friend wanted to go."
BXZtf4isG_05cbhP4g1ORw,If I can give this place 0 starts I would !!!! It's the worst place I ever had in my life . I rather eat Burger King . The hype is honestly not worth it !!
vri0zlcJTpZwmDHpYydaLQ,"My first time ever trying White Castle was waaay back in high school straight from the frozen section. I finally got the real thing in Chicago and it was pretty damn good especially for the price. So how's this White Castle in Vegas? 

Nothing special sadly. There was just something missing. Not only were the prices higher here, the quality was definitely off. Where they took their time in Chicago putting these sliders together, things were rushed out of the kitchen at this location. These sliders were made with hate and you can taste it. The cheese unmelted, the burgers smashed into its containers, and the flavors sorely lacking. Where is the caramelized onion flavor white castle is known for? I thought an establishment that sold out within hours of its grand opening would present something better than cafeteria food."
ot4w5MVtF3lRW49jYcbBRQ,"It's nice that we have a White Castle, but the price is too high for the quality of the experience.  The onion crisps are very nice, though."
_4rTX2idfr5BPENXnlq41Q,"I was tired and exhausted from two nights of clubbing. I spent Sunday afternoon in bed and sleeping on and off. I refused to leave the room.

Then came my amazing friend with a bag full of White Castle goodies and a Serendipity float. I have the best friends in the world. I've never had White Castle before but holy moly it was PHENOMENAL. Maybe it's because I have a thing for tiny foods, but the grilled onions in these babies really make these sliders what they are.

I wish I can say something about the wait or price, but I will do an update on this review when I  can."
wVnvOBKrHygH3oRZeVAu-g,"Good luck finding a White Castle stand-alone restaurant anywhere in California or the West Coast. This White Castle is the closest one I know where I live, but I wouldn't make the drive solely for WC. If I'm going to Vegas, I'm gambling, going to different buffets, and having my fun while I'm out here! I've came here on two separate visits to enjoy WC burgers. Cooked fresh in front of me instead of buying the WC burgers in my local supermarket freezer or convenience store.

I'd imagine this WC gets a ton of foot traffic and their employees getting paid well doing what they do. Do they deserve $15/hr? Hell no! Because of what I said, there will often be long lines which doesn't bother me much. The food is well worth the wait, and if you love their food wouldn't you mind waiting a little longer? They also don't serve burgers, nope. Veggie sliders, fish sliders, etc are also on their menu. I don't come here for anything but their burgers. I mean aren't they known for their burgers? I don't mind variety and options, but In N Out has done so well just serving burgers!"
V3EE741pCLFrmf-5GUKytQ,"This was on my list of food places I had to try when I visited Vegas. I've always been a fan of the frozen ones. I grew up eating those. When I finally visited on 12/17/16, I was sooooo disappointed. 

I came pretty late at night and there was a line of people. The line went by fast and I ordered the original slider, cheese slider, chicken ring slider, and the onion chips. Total came to under $20 I recall which is not bad. Food came out fast and I was ready to dig in. The sliders were about the same size as the frozen ones but it seemed a bit smaller, maybe that's just me. But as others have pointed out, these taste just like the store bought ones. Depending on you, this could be a good thing? Maybe you like the consistency? 

But like others, I was just expecting so much more!! I blame the hype surrounding White Castle. This place is too hyped up and I'm not sure how others could give it 3+ stars. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna eat my frozen White Castle sliders. But don't bother going to the actual restaurant. You'll be disappointed!

Onion chips are good tho...?? I guess"
oomU5MPU5hdxohAcr67Lkw,"Four words. Over priced and over hyped. Thumps down. I know your known for small burgers, but seriously guys 5 french fries for $3 dollars is ridiculous. 

****Beware!! Patron here only if you are heavily intoxicated. (You will not enjoy these sober.)"
-y5A40dc-Ix6p6QoUrF78w,"I've always wanted to try White Castle burgers made fresh from their actual restaurant. My experience with them to this point had been buying their frozen burgers they sell across the country in most grocery stores (which I really enjoy). 

I have to say that there wasn't much difference between the fresh restaurant product and the frozen product. I even think that I am slightly fonder of the frozen one. Also the added benefit of there being no drunk people stumbling around the freezer section of your local Walmart gives getting the frozen burgers a leg up on visiting this location which is in the middle of the Casino Royale (a fun but slightly shady casino on the north end of the strip). 

Burgers were okay, fries were okayish, and prices were average. White Castle ended up being a luke warm purgatory like experience."
p6dZfO93XSRMbqA-U15ZYQ,"I had biznass nearby, so I figured I might as well finally try to come here. Although it was a decent fast food option, I'm definitely glad I didn't make this place a destination on its own. $9 for a combo meal is overpriced IMO, but hey, it's on the strip, so I'm guessing the prices are a little inflated. I usually avoid this area like the plague, so I doubt I'll come again any time soon."
Ns82jGBzzPl0zIoemW0AHg,"I lived in Indiana for 9 years. I learned to appreciate White Castle from the locals. I'm going with 5 Stars due to years of memories from that extended experience. This was before things like WC fish burgers and the newest veggie option. I don't understand all the 3 Star reviews and won't even try to. All I can do is state my own opinion. 

Venue: Very small shop, by Las Vegas standards,  that is right off the strip and is right next to/inside of  a casino. Most easily reached by walking a distance once you find a place to park. There is no convenient parking to speak of. So I recommend combining a trip to WC with something else. Small eating area that was full because the shop was so busy.

Food: The traditional White Castle menu is very simple. Onion Chips, Regular White Castle Burgers, and White Castle Cheese Burgers. But, I don't eat meat burgers anymore. So I was very interested in trying the fish burgers and veggie burgers. These are non-traditional items. I'm sure some are shocked and appalled with the concept. I was motivated to give these a try as I may not get to the midwest in the near future.

Veggie Burger: Good but a great effort at providing meatless. i appreciate the effort. They provide a choice of sauces with these as they are needed. The fish burgers were a similar strong effort. Well appreciated by those on dietary restrictions. 

Yes,  I was a bit underwhelmed by the veggie burgers but the chance to indulge myself in old memories was priceless. I'm glad I made the effort to seek out this White Castle experience.

Service: 5 Star Service from a very busy crew."
Zh6SkhtWTjVFhm7UZghwXQ,"Been drinking and playing all day and night...quick you need food stat! White castle is that quick food you just may need. Get the grease to line your stomach and cure that hangover. While white castle isn't the best food in Vegas, it is cheap, quick and gets the job done. Good fast food and would visit this place again. The staff took my order, got my food and got me out the door, can't really ask for more."
cipqHgTNXDkTq_qlHex2hQ,"White Castle was on my list 'to try' when I was in Vegas. Though I was never a fan of the frozen White Castle sandwich I still wanted to try this one.

The line was super long when we got there, and waited at least 30mins in line. We ordered two of the Cheese Sliders Combo, which came with 3 cheese sliders, fries and a drink. I wasnt really expecting too much thinking it will taste exactly like the frozen ones, but I thought they were pretty good! I wouldnt say that im obsess with it tho, lol. I would still recommend it if you're in Vegas just to say that you've tried it. Lol."
Fn9s5HdvmcuMMQi8R0SLIA,"1star is being generous !!!!

Disgusting burger ... I got the 4 burger meal

3 of the 4 burgers did not have a pickle and the onions were not fresh  
the fries were not hot ---- yuk !!


tables dirty - floors sticky - health dept needs to do an inspection"
Qh7eP_6EU9IApClwtlUCXA,"I had high expectations for the famous White Castle this place was nothing great the soda even sucked burgers were freezer burned and the buns were so soggy the onions were disastrous this place is an abomination get your shit together White Castle you've failed us.
NO STARS IF THERE WAS AN OPTION!!!!
ITS NOT EVEN REAL MEAT ITS GREY COLORED WITH HOLES"
iv5Xp48dDWISd62Fuftr3A,"I really didn't think the sliders were that good here. It seems all hype and its so busy since it's usually on the East Coast and this is the closest location to me (I'm from CA). I don't know if it's worth coming here and looking for this if you're on the strip like we did... The sliders and chicken rings tasted microwaveable and the French fries tasted old and weren't crunchy. My friend also said it tasted just like the ones you can get at the store. The sliders are so small too and they only have a thin piece of meat, cheese, onions and a pickle--not what I was expecting. 

#2-- 4 cheese sliders, a small fry and a soft drink were not worth $9.27. Good thing I split it with a friend and we got more food after! 

I'm sorry White Castle... I'm not sure if I'll be back. :("
gwOYzAsvJqaFHgcvjEq2nQ,Late night snacks? Definitely. I think ti was $4 for a double slider and loaded fries. Can't go wrong with either!
m2QzejQjG889QVWsyKj8zw,"Finally decided to try the White Castle on the strip. There sure is a lot of people standing around doing nothing on shift. There's about 20 employees behind the counter together yet maybe only five or so are actually working. No wonder the line is out the  door, not because their busy but because they have employees standing around aimlessly chit chatting instead of working. Hmmmm a lot of unhappy customers in line."
BKSoS1f7VMmOobFF8-dZ_g,"Finally people on the west coast get a White Castle Restaurant! For the tourists, it would be easiest to park at The Venetian and then walk south on the strip.

I really liked the Cheeseburger sliders. The way its cooked makes it a little soft, but i really liked it. It's different from all the other fast food places here. The fries are nothing special (just not my thing) but they did have the bonus of reminding me of my childhood. My suggestion would be to get the loaded fries.

Can't wait to go back and try more! I loved that they had Mell Yello!"
rvE7BsSbZz1GEZlp4LfFhA,"Got a crave case. Majority of the burgers were luke warm or half cold and thrown together sloppily. Time of day was around 3:30am and it wasn't crazy busy. 

Spent almost $50 and could have done way better with $15 at dell taco.

The best part of this experience was the smoke drenched casino attached and the jameson filled Irish coffee you can get while waiting 30min to get inside. 

If you want White Castle go to the frozen food section at your local grocery store."
ZCxSprLl4cvAmMxEdRcsdg,My first time ever!! And it did not disappoint! We grabbed one of the large packs which included 20 sliders. They are small since they are sliders but they are yummy! Flavorful cheesy meaty goodness that melts in your mouth!
naq1RWW7eg5IX4zqRm4Wlg,"White Castle. 

I'm from the east coast, so I've had WC before, and I was pretty excited they were opening on the strip. 

I found myself on the strip at 5:45 am, less than 16 hours after the grand opening and judging by the line I figured this may be my only shot to ever eat here. 

Even at 6 am it was pretty packed. I only ordered 2 sliders and onion chips and waited for my food. And waited for my food. And...

See, the issue is, there's always going to be some yahoos getting a crave case or a crave crate (100) that is going to hold up the line. I also saw people getting their food before me that ordered after me, and my order was quite small. 

Pros: 

It tastes exactly like the White Castle you have grown to love. 

Cons:

The price is a bit higher than your typical standalone WC. 

The wait is always going to be outrageous. 

The back of the house is absolutely filthy. Like, worse than Waffle House. 

If you've got the time, and you want some White Castle, have at it. I'm not sure I'll be back. 

Three *** - Only because I knew what I was getting into."
GuU4Yfss-bCddaHlCqzVLA,"White Castle is located inside Casino Royale.  I wish it was sectioned off better.  You can really smell the smoke when you are eating.

 It was nice to finally try White Castle, since there are none near me.  The burgers are pretty small.  I liked how the burger bun was really soft.   We also ordered the fries, which are crinkle cut. 

 Overall, there are a few tables inside for customers to enjoy their food.  Its a good place to grab a quick snack."
D2Ksf4bjjYG9oDbXV4MvuA,"I ordered one of the combinations and let me start by saying that it was like the food was mush in small buns nasty.
the sad part was I really excited to try their food!"
Li25a6JPRubQFP-QdKDt4A,Our group bought the 30 pack for about 8 ppl and it was so damn delicious! Ate a couple before pre gaming and then ate the rest when we came back. I prefer it with cheese. Minus one star cuz the fries sucked.
mftOLsqrF2hbdbBuvY_tlg,"It was worth the experience to see what all the hype was about. 5 stars for service and burgers....1 star for the prices, although being on the strip I expected to pay more, It was a little much. The frozen ones from the grocery store are just as good:)"
LNmVur1fw6NmoOaY9wtmAw,"Wow, this is the worst thing I have ever had. This is not a hamburger I'm not quite sure what this is but it's terrible. I would rather eat a jack in the box and that's not saying much. I'm not sure why people keep telling me this place is good."
-eko3xroPDLbtFexNAYxTA,We thought we would be waiting in line forever but they were quick and efficient! And they taste so damn good!! So glad there's a White Castle on the West Side! :)
qEpnKbWhlKFgjevnmTMG4w,"cool for us west coast people.  came here late night 2 am and maybe 4am.  place was pretty clean.  food came out fast.  no complaints here.  minor issue of someone passed out and some goofballs trying to take pictures of the dude koed.  

yeah-burgers
        -onion rings
ok-fries

no-chicken rings

fast, quick, easy
done!

the food is w.e but hey now ive been to white castle.  me and harold we did it"
op0682nqlLJ0BM5nhNQEBQ,"My friends and strangers alike were telling me, urging me, don't get my hopes up for White Castle. It's not worth it. 

But for me, it was worth it every one bit. I ordered one of every type of burger. The double burger with jalapeno cheese was my favorite--so melty, so soft, so delicious and perfect. I literally could have finished it in a bite. Burgers were not greasy one bit. 

We tried the onion chips as a side since they seemed to be the most unique. I could have done without them, but they were a nice accompaniment. 

I love watching the employees make the little burgers. So efficient and coordinated. It's gross looking at the raw little patties (I mean, who knows what's in that meat despite them emphasizing it's 100% beef) but still, it was delicious. 

I can imagine myself finishing an order of 30 burgers if I could...

White Castle isn't In-n-out, my forever favorite, but every time I'm in Vegas, I'll be making a stop here."
Es3xPNl46jRuTzqjCopvgw,"UGH!!
Service is great but these burgers suck!
Theyre over prices and taste like ass... I dont know what the hype is all about. You can catch me at IN N Out or even nasty McDonalds before eating one of these again!

3 stars is LITERALLY ONLY for the customer service"
5lP50kxQ12hpoWGI5JZ_7Q,"Not impressed at all! Was looking forward to this Whitecastle as I had eaten the sliders from the frozen food aisle in the grocery store when I was a teenager. I guess it would be different if I grew up with them and it was nostalgic, but I didn't and they're just gross and $1.59 per slider with cheese... Ridiculous!  Excellent customer service, though...nice people!"
-uFpNpGL2r21MLeU1UJG_w,Very good as I remember them growing up in Bronx N.Y . Have not had one in years. They need to put one in every state. These burgers are good when you have a lot of kids with you.
XgRf95B6ywtFwE9tzZR40Q,That was probably the most disgusting burger I have ever had. I could only eat the fries. lol
sIPTFtWxSNlalAD2DXc7sA,"One word: overrated! 

This place is not even in the same ballpark as some of the great burger joints! Came here with high expectations due to: 
1) Everyone ranting and raving about how great the burgers are
2) It's renowned reputation in the East Coast
3) they made a movie about how amazing it is! 

Always wanted to try it after watching Harold and Kumar so naturally when I had a chance to dig into a pack of these ""amazing burgers"" during my last trip to Vegas, how could I not??? 

Although the service was great, the staff worked hard & fast, and the restaurant was constantly being cleaned (thus the 3 stars), the burgers were just OK and left something to be desired. They were mini burgers with paper thin meat that you could hardly taste and bread that was somewhat soggy due to the pickles/onions. it was a huge let down when I took my first bite. I immediately regretted being overly excited and buying a whole pack of these mediocre burgers! My husband and I didn't get through our pack of burgers and ended up throwing them away knowing we weren't going to eat them later. 

Huge disappointment!  :("
ZYgYH9sj7MB99riBHsLVQQ,"The verdict is in......it's a 'Naah' for me. I had been wanting to check this place out after seeing it on a cooking channel about fast food burgers. My little itty bitty teenie weenie, did I mention teenie weenie, oh yea I did, super micro thin patty was a sight to behold if I could find the darn thing! I have never experienced a meat slider so tiny before. The flavor was very meh and it was just very lack luster. The onion finger thingy's were good, they tasted like a crispy onion ring. The fries were the average crinkle frozen fries so party there. Overall, I didn't like it enough to eat there again. On to the next spot!"
-qnvpIU7acL2R_kMkpjm8g,"I finally got a chance to try out this place. I tried a little bit of everything. My favorite was the onion chips, but I'm a big fan of deep fried, battered onions. I liked the fish burger, but I wish they put sauce on it. The chicken breast burger was just OK but also needed some sauce & seasoning. Last, I got the cheeseburger. It was OK and had too much filler in it that it didn't taste like hamburger meat. Also, it was pretty bland. I liked the soft buns on everything, but it's not enough to bring me back. For tiny sandwiches, it ended being pretty pricey. Service was good."
9h7Yi5gO6a_HvCuWaCB3Aw,"There are only two reasons to go here. And if you're here for any other reasons, then this place is nothing more than a 2 star. 

1. You've seen harold and Kumar and they somehow brainwashed you to believe that this is the best burger ever.
2. You're fucked up and can't make any real logical decisions.

All of my stars go to Harold and Kumar. The burger gets none. I am never coming back"
rT3lGuWhX5vy8oizMpFwTg,"Mmmm White Castle...brings me back to my college days every time I visit one! I was stoked when I heard they were opening a WC in Vegas because that means I no longer have to seek them out when traveling back to the Midwest. I knew the crowds would be bad so I waited a couple weeks before checking it out. But little did I know there would still be crowds and long lines! If you come to this location, expect to wait in 2 separate lines: 1 outside to get into the store and another to order once you get inside. The security guards were a little rude during this whole process, which may turn me off from this location for a while, at least until the lines die down a little.

This location is also much more expensive than other WC locations I've been to...probably because it's located on the Las Vegas Strip versus some southside hood. The food is on par with any other WC's and is something people either love or hate. You'll never meet someone that just thinks White Castle is alright. They will either love it or hate it and this one is no exception. 

My favorites here are the cheeseburger sliders and chicken rings. Their fries suck so I would stay away from those. I thought maybe this location would be different because it would be fresher due to higher turnover from the crowds but nope...still sucks! They had a full staff working and the food comes out surprisingly fast for the amount of customers they're serving. Like all their locations, this one is 24/7 so you can get your fix anytime!"
PnwuvmL2wfheyiAY-pD0jg,"It is late night, hangover food. The sliders are squishy in texture. The fries are fast food fries. It isn't bad, but it won't make your tastebuds sing either. It's a cheap meal when you are hungry and broke on the strip."
UF5JB5_r6tQFhDznct5yOQ,"The three stars is mainly for the employees working here, they are super nice. 

This is my first time trying White Castle and I really wanted to see what the hype was all about, but I was so disappointed. The beef patty is so thin you are basically eating steamed buns with pickles and cheese. The onion fries I got tasted how I expected it to taste, basically cut up onion rings. Glad I finally got to try this after so many years, but basically one and done for me."
4DeCMaqeufskUe4TUG7-QA,"It's an experience not to be repeated.  The burgers are slider size which is fine but they have no taste, ours weren't even warm and why would you want to stand in line for that?"
juifWE0Q8CPXDy3-DsGkVA,"First time trying White Castle out and it was what I expected. These little cheap burgers definitely hit the spot. I wasn't expecting the soggy/steamy taste but it was surprisingly good. The area seems a bit sketch and the casino nearby looks a bit run down, but the food was good so I can't complain. I also don't see much crinkle fries around and this place had them! I ended going back the next day to get more of those delicious square burgers. Will definitely come back whenever I'm in Vegas again."
KTlqObKL6CRnQXsYi4WsCQ,"honestly, for the trouble we went through to get here, I would not do it again. nothing special about these lil ass burgers. cheeseburgers from McDonald's are way better. trust me."
bLiqh4PgkxtrOTYoY850Kg,"Every time I see this place, I think about Harold & Kumar go to White Castle.
Although I've seen and passed by this place every year for the past several years, I finally decided to come in and try the place in February.
I actually walked from The Excalibur here and walked back. In a way, it was my own White Castle adventure.
I was able to snag a coupon from a guy about a block down and that really sealed the deal.
The restaurant was pretty packed, there were absolutely no seats available, but the line was very short when I got in. 
I got the 4pk cheese sliders with a drink and fries for about 9 bucks before the coupon. I was kind of expecting the prices I heard in the movie, but I'm thinking since this is Vegas and on the strip, everything is like 50-100% more.
Food came out within about 5mins, and I took it to go and ate at the fountain right in front of In N Out.
If you ask why I didn't just go to In N' Out, it's because I have one close to home, so I wanted something I can't get back home.
The burgers themselves actually didn't look very appealing. The meat kind of looks like spam (not that I have anything against spam). I have had the frozen ones before and those looked better.
As for the taste, it wasn't bad. Typical fast-food burger taste, but the little chopped grilled onions add a lot of flavor. I was pretty full after eating all 4 of the sliders.
I would probably come back again if I had a longer stay in Vegas. If I'm only here just a few days, I would probably rather have something a bit nicer.
The only exception is that my brother is pretty crazy about these, so if he ever comes along on one of my trips to Vegas, I'll bring him here so he can try to eat 20 of these lol."
o4m5pSc6I0-hEhBGqu9o3w,"Came here for an early lunch. I think it was 10:30 am when we got here. 

This White Castle is located on the strip near Venetian hotel and casino. Hubby wanted to come here. 

I was not impressed but super hungry. I got a number 2 which consisted of 4 small White Castle cheeseburgers with crinkle cut fries and a drink. I enjoyed the crinkle cut fries. I had a raspberry iced tea. The burgers were filled with cheese and pickles. I don't like pickles in our burgers. I think this place gets too much hype. Place had refill Coke soda station like the old school fountains. Descent place to eat. 

The guy at the register was super nice. The guy calls your number when your food is ready. You basically dump your own trash. There is plenty of seating. At least I got to try this place once."
W2nvhL7cL8awH-nz1vIw2g,"I don't know what to say about White Castle sliders...

Realistically speaking, there shouldn't be any reason why a slider from White Castle should be appealing: (1) cheap, soft, over processed rolls which are reminiscent of what you can expect from the buffet at Pondegrossa, (2) over-cooked, greasy patty cut in a ridiculous, bite-sized 2x2 inch square, (3) a diced and sliced mixture of onions and pickles that are better suited for a hot dog or a stupid, McDonald's hamburger...

...And yet, they're surprisingly good.  They have the faintest philly cheesesteak aspect to them that I find irresistible.  And unlike a cheesesteak, which has sliced rib eye steak, a White Castle slider can't be nearly as expensive to replicate that flavor.  I'd say they're on to something, but then again they've been doing this for a while.  After all, some movie director even made a movie with the White Castle name on it which forever immortalized it in the bong-resin charred brains of stoners everywhere.

As far as I'm concerned, I only seem to dip into a White Castle every decade or so, but I was pleased to see that they have all kinds of different sliders these days: chicken sliders, jalapeno sliders, fish sliders, etc.    Maybe next time I'll get a double cheese slider and a bacon & cheddar grilled chicken slider.  Who knows?  It might get really weird."
QrbqQ7ezmwetptoM_3ztdg,"This place was the worst! They hype up this place too much. DO NOT GO IN THERE WITH EXPECTATIONS!!! The burgers look fake and ridiculously tiny. 
Sad to say but McDonalds is better! Never again"
2ycWQR4S_YCcr9ZoZbEpsg,"We were so excited to try this place and we highly disappointed. Unfortunately, $60 worth of food went into the garbage. What a waste!"
Qz9kkNNOihMJ5ngDgtVa8w,I went here for my first time and the food was great. Shaylene was very friendly and patient when my party didn't know what we wanted. She even recommended some items to us.
mtvhcXeAo9QQs9xYTKtaHw,"Las Vegas White Castle is NOTHING like an ORIGINAL White Castle.
VERY rude staff.
Las Vegas White Castle is nothing like the original White Castle we use to eat from, back in Michigan. The food does not taste the same like the White Castles in Midwest..
They don't even offer their best burgers in a the Las Vegas location."
1gIDRE-0aen_aQ4B-do2zA,"I really don't have much to say. I've grown up eating these and when I found out there was one in Vegas, I was stoked. I'll be sure to make my way to Vegas a little more often now."
456gxHPkDk0KCCn-uWgT9A,"Currently drunk,  hungover or nearly out of money should be the only reason to stop here.  It does the job of filling you up for a low price.  Nothing special except for the people watching."
4dlL9i7nXJMS8Mn2_oWULQ,"I remember as a kid having White Castle from the frozen food section of the grocery store and I was not too impressed with them back then. So when we saw they had a location to try on the strip I was interested in trying them. Well the taste is no better then what you would get from the grocery store, so might as well stick with that if they are the same plus you don't have to wait in long lines like you do at this place. On the bright side they are pretty inexpensive compared to the other food choices offered on the strip."
f_fY6-77NVcntcMNl0OhMA,"The food is fabulous, just what I remembered. Strip prices sure, a meal with 2 burgers fries and drink is 7.99. The restaurant it self is small I was expecting a larger place with their fan following but the service was very fast for as busy as they were and we will definitely go back to get our White Castle fix!"
XGtjbErRFXfomrH01yiXCA,I was amped up to come here mainly because of the movie and also I've only ever had the frozen burgers. I was also curious what else White Castle had to offer other than the obvious. I had chicken rings which were basically like chicken nuggets with a hole in the middle. The burgers tasted pretty close to the flavor I've experienced with the frozen kind. I don't know if that speaks to White Castle's ability to freeze and recreate in the microwave or what. It's okay. Wouldn't make the trip to this part of the strip specifically for White Castle but wouldn't object if I was part of a group who all wanted to eat there.
tzBkCbxt6tsrYfL2hqK-Cw,Great customer service nice location right in the casino. We forgot to ask for cheese and they gave us some on the side for free. Cheese is big deal for me and they were so accommodating.  If u have a big appetite and looking to sober up go to another food place or order like 10 burgers. I ate like four burgers and was still hungry.
mFRBDpmUPks3PDpwxlFGBQ,"I was actually expecting something... more exciting. 

My friends and I ordered the sliders.  They tasted pretty okay. The soft texture of the bun, the thin patty, and the diced onions, reminded me of the little hamburgers in the Happy Meals from McDonalds. The presentation is cool and all, with the little boxes, but other than that, there's really nothing special about them. 

And the way that it's so hard to find somewhere to sit and how messy the area is.. it just kills the appeal some more for me."
eeijzmFoJWWItTXiy0xDGg,Was expecting sooooo much but was soooo underwhelmed.  I couldn't even get ketchup or mustard on my burger! Come on man! So disappointed. Better off getting the frozen ones! Oh and it's like triple the price from back home!
WwGAg8GTLRdeQ2__dn9QHA,"The place looks okay, but nothing that's too appetizing that I would like yo come back here. 
My husband and I tried chicken, beef, and fish sliders. And all three of them didn't live up to the flavor, didn't like the food at all."
Lieyrj7hV_TWKPYCVEL1Aw,"Lov love love this I wished we had this on OAHU, HI!"
p9HJKkWkHWWbcIUoyxdn0Q,"I just want to point out how thin these ""hamburger patties"" are. This place was full of mediocracy. 12 buck on 4 sliders and cheese bacon fries and we are leaving less than dissatisfied. 2 stars because the fries were good but save your self some time and walk a little bit down the strip to a joint called in-n-out! So sad, because we were excited to try something from the east coast!!! Maybe it's just this place, I will give White Castle another try while in NY. But never here again"
DTTTa6ki5hieUVJTwH6gcQ,"When I found out they were opening a white castle here I was pretty excited. I had only ever had the ones in the freezer section, which a friend told me was not ""real White Castle."" Spoiler alert: they were basically identical. I didn't come here looking for some amazing burgers but I was looking for something worth all the hype. $6 for 4 little sliders seems pretty pricey. These things taste just like McDonald's double cheeseburgers except they are about a third of the size and the same price. Luckily there was no line when I came. The extra star is basically just because the employees were nice."
J0VC9wLcIRNl4NbTThTm3w,"I feel silly reviewing the actual burger - surely it's something you've had before and can't we all just agree Krystal has vastly superior cheap sliders ? The burger itself isn't anything special and clearly it has to be a nostalgic thing for you to actually enjoy eating them (how brainwashed are you Midwestern people?). That being said my pregnant self wanted a slider for a snack at 10 AM and this place delivered. There was no wait at 10:00 AM (surprise surprise) and the food was cheap (for the strip) and came out very quickly (maybe 3 mintues?). The place was clean, not overly crowded and a nice fast snack option for when you're roaming the strip."
Iwu2SQv-_Uvb67CG9mRhyQ,"This is the WORST WORST WORST PLACE. It is over hyped. Watching Harold and Kumar made me think this place was going to be awesome, BUT NO. This place is horrible. I have the food, the fries were not even great. And the meat...is that even meat? It comes with pickles and onions. If you have ever been to inn n out you would know that it's not comparable at all. I don't know why everyone loves it. I absolutely despise it. The wait is about 10-15 minutes and its definitely not even worth a second of it. The only thing I enjoyed was my soda..."
hRNE7pLmLHpBuBoxdHusuQ,"If you're looking for garbage, this is the place to go. Came here in the AM expecting some decent, if not lower quality food to fill my drunken hungry state. The quality and taste of this food is absolutely appalling. This establishment needs to shut itself down for the betterment of he public. The only reasonably enjoyable portion of my meal was the soda that came from the soda machine."
qsriX1J5qDOm0PKFX0Jh0A,"The 2 stars are exactly what it means. I have experienced better. Whether it is the frozen ones at Smiths in the frozen food section or sliders from other restaurants, the actual sliders I had here at this location was mediocre at best if I was I really hungry.

Im trying to understand how east coast  peeps grew up on this garbage. This is definitely one of those spots that are severely hyped up because of the fact that this is the only White Castle closest to the west coast. The funny thing is that the first day they opened, they ran out of food! What a fail on their part. You're open 24 hours. You know you're gonna have patrons lined up for miles but yet you just happen to run out of product. 

I knew eventually I had to try it just to see what the hype was. I have only tried the frozen ones so far. So a couple of my friends are here from out of town. Of course they want to try it. So off we went.

Located just inside the Casino Royale just right off the strip, you line up starting outside if it is really busy. One thing is for sure, I dont think this casino has never seen so many people in their establishment. Since it is a part of the casino, you will be exposed to the smoke factor. You cant smoke where you can sit down and eat your burger but yet you will be inhaling enough of it coming from the casino itself. They have security posted outside where the line begins and one right at the door where you enter.

So far I have gone 4 paragraphs without any mention of what we ordered. That just shows you how really bad the food is. While my wife went and stayed in line to order food, I scoped out a table. She came back with two craver packs for our group along with loaded fries and 4 drinks. The total came out to 51 bucks and some change. 

I was somewhat hungry so I ate 2 regular sliders with cheese. In the other craver pack I also ate 2 regular sliders with pepper jack cheese. Now I LOVE onions but the ones they put in these sliders taste like reconstituted onions. You know, the dry kind that has to be mixed with water to bring it back to life. Then they grill it. The smell of it now that I think about it almost makes me want to vomit. The patty itself does not look like a real beef patty. Referring to my pic, it looks more like prop comparable to those fake plastic fruits you will see in some people's homes. The only thing that may have peaked my interest was the pepper jack cheese. Had a little kick to it. As for the loaded fries, I was no longer in the mood to eat after surprisingly eating 4 sliders.

Service was actually decent, otherwise this would be a 1 star review. From standing outside to making it in to order, all took a total of about 25 minutes with 10 waiting for our finished product after ordering. They have one security guard outside to watch the line while another one is at the door entrance to make sure nobody cuts. This was surprisingly organized. Too bad that's it. Oh and that they are open 24 hours would be the other thing.

In closing, if you have never been here, by all means, try it out so you can make up your own mind if its worthy of a trip to the Casino Royale. I mean, you don't really hear too many people talk about going to the strip just to go to a not too well known casino.

Ohn4k2ZfC9r6FDtHgrnmKA,"Absolute trash. I've heard so many stories from my friends on why I must try out White Castle burgers so sure enough I went. It was about 1 AM and I was starving so I dropped by to get some burgers. Given that I was starving and have heard such great things about this place I was very excited.

Little did I know this place is literally the worst burger joint I have ever gone too. Their burgers look like they are frozen and then simply just microwaved. I would NEVER come back here again and would advise that everyone stay away."
clTHpenolinUjZMY6bSLmA,First timer to white Castle and definitely NOT the last! Attached to Harrah's casino.
7rAwkvk1uypR10dvde9TrQ,A typical White Castle but very well maintained & the staff were timely as well as friendly. Fresh sliders to go were on point & delicious.
v7eSpoBZ2FyOPF7MwQDDRQ,"This place conveniently next to The Venetian comes in CLUTCH when it's past 2am and most of the major/good foodie spots along the Strip are closed and you just really need something to EAT. While the wait is a bit long and it's not the most high quality fast food, it gets the job done (and the hangovers cured, let's be real)."
dlBrJlEvwxj05OxzTNuSng,"My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch today. We wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Neither one of us was impressed. I had to choke, literally choke down my sliders, then was nauseous the rest of the evening. Buns, were soggy, meat tasted old. Fries were of the frozen variety, not evenly cooked or seasoned. We paid roughly $10 for the #2 and shared it.. let's just say I can get a steak and lobster for that price in town and not be sick or disappointed. We can say we've  scratched it off of our bucket list, but will not be back."
1Nj8889bQuCpv5PHUayUQQ,"These burgers are (in a musical tone) teerribbllle!
Wow I thought in and out burgers were bad, I could not even finish my food here. I took it out to the bums outside and even they wernt real happy about the offer.  This Food really sucks.... wtf.."
vtW8X2_eEizG1hOGX1U2Og,"White Castle of the East on the Vegas of the West!

I've been to a White Castle before in the Bronx of NYC wile on tour being that is the only other time I've actually had their food you so know that we are going here especially late night after a few drinks!

Being from California we don't have White Castles anywhere around so we go to In In Out and it's always just magically delicious and what we crave!

The burgers here were soggy but I think it's because they steam them overall I'm not a fan of soggy buns I wasn't impressed enough by the burgers to ever really want to visit one of their locations again.

The onion chips were decently good though and went well with their BBQ sauce and made your burger taste a bit better if you added one to it.

The other thing I thought was funky was how they had chicken rings and onion chips either way I don't find my self craving anything from here like they advertise.

The line moves fairly quick though well at least for us it did as well as our food came out quickly too!

They sell beer here too so that's definitely awesome if your in it for a burger and beer!

Well what I will say is if you have never visited a White Castle and your next to one after you've had a few drinks pay them a visit because you might like it more than I did."
0fM6bia_zsMa-Sar_KLtpA,I'm confused. Why would you choose this place over all other places in Vegas? It's terrible. I had to try it because of the movie and I'm from the west coast so this was my chance but it was a lesson learned. Never coming back. Flavorless. Worst fries ever. Mystery meat? Why is the line so long? Welcome to stinktown.
kD76gKFDXf3-oerphBufUg,"Fries were good, but the burgers were just any old burger slapped together but just made mini."
86nYIULyixFgatW8wIdwBg,"Oh how I love these little sliders. These sliders take me back to my youth and they are amazing. It is Las Veags, and it is a bit pricey,  but for any true sliders fan;  they know these are the best little burgers. The flavor is amazing and the softness of the bread is excellent. I love how they cook the sliders over a bed of steamed onions. Nothing has changed here since I first had one as a little kid. If you did not grow up on these sliders than you missed out. I love White Castle. Finally the west coast is catching up."
LvEGicfJu29om_9d40Mq8A,"For over 30 years I've been hearing about White Castle sliders from those that lived in, or traveled to parts of the country that offered them. Then, after Harold and Kumar made their movie, I truly hoped that one day I would travel to a place in the mid west or eastern parts that had a White Castle Burger joint, or even better, I wished that White Castle would open a store here in Southern California. Sadly, no luck either way. Then voila! I saw them in the frozen section of my local super market. I bought a pack, took them home and immediately nuked a few in the microwave. Not bad I thought to myself. They had a unique flavor with kind of an onion tang. Nevertheless, these were frozen burgers. I knew the freshly made ones had to be better, so I withheld final judgement, and continued to hope for a real experience at a White Castle location.

Fast forward several years and I'm walking the strip in Las Vegas and the White Castle sign hit my like a ton of bricks! There it  was! Boom! A real deal White Castle burger joint right here in Las Vegas, and right in front of me! I dragged the wife into the place and immediately placed an order for sliders, fries and a drink. So let me get this out of the way first, I don't like krinkle fries. And, the White Castle krinkle fries were no different than any other krinkle fries I've tried. So what did I think of the sliders? They were really tasty and much better than the frozen ones, as I expected them to be. These are truly unique sliders. They are steamed with the onion on the patties. I think that's part of what makes them distinctive.

Now, if I'm only judging the slider, in the context of the fast food world of large or popular burger chains, I give it 5 stars considering the under $2 price. I don't smoke weed, but if I did, I could see myself eating a bag of these little morsels after smoking a bowl, just like Harold and Kumar did in the movie. 

The slider is the only thing that stood out. Again, I didn't care for the fries, and everything else was just okay. Service was decent, drink fountain was nothing special. Over all, 4 stars for White Castle, mostly because of their famous sliders."
wcljx7MelKn4INEwcn9SqA,"What's all the hype???? I will never understand. 

Upon arrival to Vegas, two of my friends were so excited about this place, so we ended up going here on our second day for a late lunch. I ordered a regular combo that came with 4 burgers, fries and a drink. They were so unorganized that I ended up with someone else's food, but after standing there for 8 mins I decided to just roll with it. I actually ended up with some little tasty onion crispers instead of fries. Now, I will say that I liked them a lot, but the burgers were exactly like a Krystal burger ( no biggie, nothing major ), it looked like a Krystal & tasted like a Krystal. I later had a tummy ache. There restaurant set up is wide open, so you can see everything going in the kitchen area. 

 The restaurant dining area was a complete mess, I mean,  if you know you have that much traffic coming thru your restaurant, one would think you would have a clean up staff on duty at all times. 

I wasn't impressed, once was enough for me."
HXaFETDCxGGUefLQWOUPhA,"This probably deserves a 4-star rating given most people's expectations, so let me clarify before I get into the review: I have no real qualms about this place besides the price. The burgers are nearly as good as those in the Midwest.

So, the GOOD:

- Burgers are nearly as good as the Midwest
- They give you as many ketchup packets as you want (you probably need to ask if you want any at all)
- The place seemed clean enough during a busy night around 1 in the morning
- The wait wasn't bad, for the ordering line or for the pickup line

The BAD:

- The main thing is the price. It shouldn't be more than a dollar per burger, and obviously buying more burgers should give you some sort of deal. But it's (as of April 2016) $35.99 for a crave case (30 plain sliders), which is almost the exact same price as 30 individual sliders. Likewise, it costs 30 cents to add cheese to a slider. If you add cheese to all 30 sliders, you might expect some deal. Nope. 30 cents times 30 slices of cheese is 9 dollars, which is the exact amount you'll have to add to your price if you want 30 sliders with cheese instead of regular sliders. That means you're paying $44.99 for 30 tiny sliders...and that's before taxes.

Look, I know it's the Vegas strip, so I don't really mind the price that much. Everything's more expensive, and the constant stream of customers proves they're asking a fair market price. Still, I'm taking away a star because that's just way too much money for those tiny burgers. It costs the same amount for 30 tiny sliders as for like 30 full size McDoubles.

- The burgers aren't quite as good as in the Midwest. They're still good -- they'll satisfy if you're a White Castle fan like myself -- but they're just slightly lacking. I think the problem is that they use this large island grill where something like 4 people work at once, and that open setup results in the steam escaping. For those who don't know, part of the magic of White Castle is that the burgers are cooked by steaming them over a bed of onions. So that onion flavor permeates the entire burger and bun. But with the Vegas location setup, I think the steam doesn't do it's job. Which also results in less moist buns.

But don't let this sway you from going here. Still very good.

- The staff wasn't all that friendly. Not that they were rude. When I asked for ketchup, the guy gave me plenty of ketchup, but didn't even look at me as he was serving me. The people on the grill looked a bit miserable. That's understandable, given they probably spend their day making millions of sliders non-stop because this is a hugely busy location. The girl taking orders was neither friendly nor unfriendly.

- The menu is a bit poorly done. The cheese options, for instance, are listed as a footnote at the top (are those still called footnotes?) where it mentions that you can add cheese or jalapeno cheese. For those unfamiliar with the White Castle menu, they'll probably just miss that option entirely.

- It's WAY at the end of the strip (that is, the part furthest from the 15 freeway). Not as far as Trump Hotel, but past the Venetian. So if you're down near Excalibur, or even the Cosmopolitan, you've got a long walk ahead of you. Might be better to drive to closer hotel and walk. Harrah's parking is free and easy to access off the strip (not sure about other hotels -- do your own research).

SUMMARY:

Go here. It's good.

So why the low rating? I'm taking off two stars because of 1) price and 2) not having the service or taste that lives up to the Midwest experience. But it's still quite good -- I just can't justify mathematically giving it 5 stars because 5 stars would be the standard White Castle experience, which this misses. But going here was still awesome.

PRO TIP: White Castles are excellent breakfast food. Let them sit overnight -- keep the burger cases overlapping to trap the moisture in! -- then let them sit out overnight and enjoy the next day.

Always consume with ketchup.

HELPFUL INFO for the uninitiated:

White Castle sliders are tiny and come standard with chopped, slightly grilled onion, and a pickle. No mustard or ketchup. You have to ask for ketchup packets if you want, but it's easier to bring your own bottle so you don't spend your meal opening and squeezing out 30 packets.

For guys with a young appetite, you could easily consume 10 sliders. Something like 6 might be enough for you.

Women and girls with lesser appetites might be satisfied with 2-4 sliders.

Don't forget to try out their other stuff, like jalapeno cheese, onion rings, etc. It's all good stuff."
qSAUkdc8-SueDBuNHGbSRQ,"I felt like I had to try it since it's so well known, talked about, and movie about it. I never make it to the east coast and now that there is one in Vegas, I had to try it. So far I've only had the frozen ones which are just ""ok"". Well unfortunately it tasted the same as frozen. Guess that says how good of a job they did with the frozen burgers, but also about how ""meh"" the burger is. I'd imagine the prices are a lot higher at the Vegas location than ones on the east coast, at least I hope so for there sake. They had combos with 2 or 3 sliders and the things are so tiny I wouldn't be surprised if people easily take down 10. I got a single, a double, then split some onion rings (although they werent rings, what? they qere quarters) and chicken rings (which actually were rings). There is way better food on the strip, especially for burgers, but if you go here, I suggest just trying it for a drunking snack, not for a real meal."
fSaL6qdu_jJ2ELAi-bRiqA,"So when I heard this famous east coast fast food burger joint was coming to Vegas, I was really hyped! But when we got there it was met with disappointment! The burgers tasted exactly like they came out of the frozen food section. I mean if that's how it's suppose to taste, that's fine but I was disappointed. It was nice to finally eat at this world famous joint but wasn't impressed. The chicken rings and onion chips were pretty good and that's why it's an average (3 star) rating. The wait was nonexistent. We walked right in and ordered (we went in on a Wednesday around 11am). We found it easiest to get there by parking at the Venetian and walking towards the strip and hanging a left."
9F2e3CkKQDNzjyxn_n2OYA,"Even with people ordering Craver Crates of 100+ White Castle sliders in front of me, my order came out fully cooked in less than 15 minutes. That's amazing for a Grand Opening first day.

White Castle is now open on the Las Vegas Strip, across from The Mirage and inside of the Casino Royale. They serve beer via those cool stadium bottom up cups. The sliders are small, so be sure to order more than a few at a time.

Their drink stations easily accommodated all of the people on opening day, so they should be good to go from now on. I like their fudge covered cheesecake bite on a stick for dessert."
ZO92xRIcdiAASwQ2nhVQHQ,"I was not expecting a lot from White Castle, as they do not advertise any gluten -free options. I was overly impressed. The manager at the location took the time to explain how they grill their burgers and said that they could make their sliders with no buns. They even cleaned the grill before they made them and kept them separate from all of the other burgers. The taste of the burger was amazing for fast food. They were a little pricey, but the flavor of the food made up for the price. I would definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a quick and delicious night night snack!"
0oOcchLp--z6V2EEuWei2w,"Most people that eat here know what White Castle belly bombers are. Or the very similar Crystal burgers. They aren't  gourmet burgers by any means, but these little squares are addicting! Like little sliders that everyone should try. And this is probably the only one, anywhere, that serves beer too!"
N6a3untNvHdnm2AEKSyahw,"Being a self proclaimed burger expert I had been waiting to come here for ages. Last time I came to Vegas I didn't find out there was a white castle here till I had left. This time however I made a point to come here. Now I've been eating quality burgers my whole life and yes I can be a little critical at times. However when I came to white castle in Vegas I was in a very vulnerable position. I was extremely hungover, even a big Mac would have made me happier than anyone could imagine.

So I naturally got in line and asked what I should order since it was my first time at white castle. I got a very vague response that the beef was good and that the chicken was good as well. With this information I order 4 beef sliders, 2 chicken sliders, fries and a drink for a total of around $17. I got the food a short time later and was very unimpressed. For $17 back in Cali I can get some very quality burgers and great service from a well known restaurant that has locations all along the west coast, Nevada, and Texas. 

These burgers were very bland and tasteless. I tried using the sauces provided and they didn't really help very much at all. The food just lacked any kick or flavor. It tasted like something that was pulled out of the frozen food section, microwaved and then given to me. 

If anyone from Cali is reading this, we aren't missing out on anything by not having white castle. The east coast however y'all definitely missing out on not having in n out."
lBbk6M0c_Sf5cDM0CcqQKA,The worst burger I have ever had in my life. The sogginess of the burger meat and the bottom bun was repulsive. Will never go there again.
IGH6-PmqIbnaB4k3Pj-F7A,"My parents and I passed by this place while we were in Vegas about two weeks ago.  I mentioned that I had heard a lot of good things about this place and that there were no locations in California where we live.  Well, that was good enough for my parents to say ""Let's go inside to check it out.""  We checked it out and then decided to eat here for our dinner as we didn't want to eat at one of the many buffet places (i.e. hotels) along the Strip.

The food was very good.  We started with the sliders combo with fries and a soda.  The sliders were awesome. One silder was clearly not enough among the three of us. We ended up ordering the fish slider.  That too was awesome.

The other great thing about our first experience was the service.  Excellent service!  The employees were very kind. They treated us like a part of the family.

I can't wait until they come to my neck of the woods."
HiZbImFBVgub3vfdz9Tzuw,"I think just like most people, my curiosity for White Castle developed after watching the first Harold & Kumar. I never wanted to settle for the frozen stuff because I wanted to try the real thing, or at least as close as I could to the real thing which was the location in Vegas.

I love sliders. If sliders are on the menu, I'm 110% all about sliders. They're just really delicious, bite-sized, soft and convenient little burgers. My girlfriend thought they were okay and tasted just like the frozen ones, but every bite was extremely satisfying.

It ended tragically though. My motor skills weren't all there and I dropped a whole slider on the floor. Rest in peace, slider I never got to enjoy."
dt5HWDFbwS8DNNF5CBeQ4w,"One of few locations west of the Mississippi. This is located in the middle of the strip. Visited early in the morning. Wanted to order beef and chicken White Castle burgers.

Offerings in the morning were fresh beef off the grill and what seemed like fairly older sitting chicken. We held off on chicken. Ordered 10 beef White Castle burgers. Onions with the mini patty burgers on buns. The burgers stayed warm for a good two hours. The fresh version of these burgers are similar to the frozen one in grocery stores.

Service was quick. Burgers are okay."
oqm2mvcgFUOOw9FI4buhTg,Heaven right here in Vegas!  Being from the East coast there are several eateries I miss.   Finally one has crossed the Mississippi!  Belly Bombs!   At first I wasn't thrilled at the location but I have changed my mind. There are tables up front by the windows perfect for people watching.  The staff has always been great and keep the tables as clean as they can.   Thank you White Castle!
wZzC0L-TkglNeurG9DIqAQ,"Oh how Harold and Kumar failed me... So much HYPE, but so little DELICIOUSNESS. First time I came here after about 10 years since I've watch the movie so I was extremely excited. This place is extremely busy and honestly the food here is mediocre. This is good quick drunk munchie type of food, but not worth the price.

I ordered the two cheeseburgers with chicken rings and the total was about $10. It is very expensive for very little food. The thing that really bothered me was one of the rude worker. After waiting for about 15 minutes to get my food, I asked the lady what type of condiments that they served here because it was my first time here. Her response was, 'well condiment do you want.' So I replied with what are your options. She was just rude about it and for some reason wouldn't tell me. I got frustrated so I just told her to tell me the ones they have so I can choose and if you can't do that then I want one of every condiment there is to offer. She finally told me and I got what I wanted, but all this altercation was very unnecessary. 

This place is pricy, has little food for what you pay for, busy, and has rude workers. No reason to ever come back here again or ever recommend people to come here. It was overly hyped due to the movie and that is the only reason this place is busy."
v0YTjiUtLlYMuyL0F2C37Q,"Yum yum yum! I had never tried White Castle before but I am definitely in love!

Those tiny sliders are so delicious! Let's get one in San Diego please!

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was the environment. It wasn't very comfortable to stay and eat when numbers and people were regularly being yelled at through the intercom...."
misrPXH_zOfDeI_tBQpHpQ,"Line moves fast here so even if long line it's so worth it.  White Castle is the best, as long as you just expect a regular burger at a great price. Anyone who complains is a food snob.  I get the microwave ones all the time so was happy to get it fresh finally with a pickle.  Us west coasters miss out. It is consistent quality and a unique experience.  Go with 4 cheese sliders,  and you'll walk out full without your wallet hurt.  I'd compare it to in and out,  it's not 5 star burger,  but the price makes it uber yummy!!!  :)"
627IBnzL4-L-XM5NWJ_FbA,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat while driving down the strip & our taxi guy recommended White Castle, he said its ""cheap and delicious"". We had tried the frozen microwaveable ones so we figured we'd try the real deal, only to find out they taste exactly the same. Like they just came out of the freezer and into the microwave, so we were disappointed. I also got a side of the onion chips and I was so grossed out when I bit into it and there was an onion peel inside instead of actual onion."
nWLDTedSq9gJDDkwH7Zj4w,Finally got to eat at White Castle in Vegas!  I believe this is the only one near the west Coast!  It was delicious and I tried almost everything on the menu!!!
q-TnRQr95IScwRsR9fDNHg,"So I'm from Texas and was in town. I've always wanted to try White Castle so I thought why not? 

Got there early around 10:30. No line and for my food quickly, but that's the only positive...

Burgers were so cold my cheese wasn't even melted. Fries were old and horrible. Wish I could say better things, but for the price you really are better going somewhere else!"
JD8bf4Y8oiRHxoJrZ4reqQ,This is a great place if you want to pay for overpriced burgers which taste exactly the same as the frozen ones that you can buy at the grocery store. Save your money and go to bachi burger or a few hundred miles to the closest in-n-out.
ej-5BYeSGi1c1dl8VX0qTQ,"So many haters...so little time. White Castle, regardless what state is in, is the bomb! Much like when I visit home (Chicago), WC is my first stop in Vegas. If  you're one to compare it to in and out, your taste buds got some evolving to do...there is no compsirison! WC is better. And if Harold and Kumar is your only refereence to these little angels, thats sad.

Much like most of the places on this strip, WC is always packed, but the staff is unfazed! The drunks, the Half Naked, the Regular Folks like me are all treated to the same great service and regular 15-30 minute wait on a good day (first visit was like an hour but since I didn't have any heart transplants to preform or any nations to conquer, i waited. That's the reason I came that day!) Because it's SO busy, you never have to worry about any food that's cold. The grill is ALWAYS going! The cost is the only thing I'm not liking. Seems about $4.00 more expensive than its Midwestern siblings for the same meal, but hey, it is Vegas. All in all I'm geeked that there is a taste of home now only 4 1/2 hours away by car and I try to take it as often as I can!"
8qJZiU4_XhANzYrUaEszkg,It was just what I expected. The line was long but they served us fast. The burgers were fresh and hot. The order was made correctly and the environment was cleaned.
ICsQBprZjaYncs-Wg04qvQ,"Overpriced cold burgers, your better off buying them at the store in the frozen food section. The long lines and mass produced burgers by the hundreds creates a cold burger that is not worth the price. Hopefully White Castle will open a few more in Vegas with the real menu that is not charging an arm and leg for a burger."
5aMZ2kcduzfvteKdIHPsqQ,"No I'm not high. I don't think. No...I'm not. 

Some friends who are strictly from the West Coast came to visit Vegas and wanted to eat at White Castle. I've never been there but thought ""if Harold and Kumar loved them, then let's go!""

I ordered 1 cheeseburger, 1 hamburger and 1 fish sandwich. All are served as sliders. I honestly really liked them. I don't really know what puts people off. Everyone in the group liked them. 

I know this place is popular, and my review won't matter, but next time I hit the strip, I'll stop by and get my ""little"" White Castle fix!"
6hH99lrhFChGNubswdMZCw,"Judge me, I'm giving 4 stars to a fast food. White Castle is rare on the west coast and that's partly what makes it so good. The closest thing to these little sliders in SoCal are in the frozen foods aisle of the grocery store.

I got loaded fries and a slider. 1 slider because I didn't know if they were going to be giant sliders or tiny ones. The fries were crispy and definitely loaded. The slider was good but not enough so I got another one. They're like the size of a post-it.

If you're comparing White Castle sliders to premium hamburgers then that's not a fair fight, White Castle goes into a category all on its own of fast food sliders. The employees are all really friendly. The food is good and soaks up all the alcohol you've been drinking."
n8M7dJ7UFBXbAzDt1POSfw,"We actually ate here on Valentine's!  Haha.  I wasn't sure if I'd had WC before, and my wife hadn't.  Plus we ate at Andre's the night before, so wth.

I'll admit that my nice experience was probably due to the fact that we were staying on the strip (so no need to drive and park), our wait on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend was less than half an hour, we met some cool people in line, and we found these two private seats over in a corner with a floor to ceiling window.

We got a ten pack plus loaded fries and a soda which really isn't much for two people.  But then again, what's the point of getting sliders if you're just going to eat 20 by yourself?  Go get In N Out instead.  I actually enjoyed the food, although I'll always prefer In N Out.  I can see why people say that you either need to grow up on it or be stoned to enjoy it.  We downed a few drinks beforehand, but I think I would still enjoy the food sober."
s_gg-GP7SadV2NtLR6P_SA,"If this wasn't in a part of the strip that is a little...questionable, then I think the overall vibe would be a bit better. Anyway. The food is cheap. It's tasty. It's a novelty. Go for the experience. Try the onion strips. Mmmm."
P8gvc3kgBuAu_WYRI0FcNA,"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle!

I have seen this movie at least 5 times and I have been eating the frozen cheeseburgers for years!!!  You can actually buy the 6 pack White Castle frozen burgers at Target, Safeway, and Walmart, which are very tasty if you microwave them properly!  The only difference from the real deal is they don't have pickles on them, yet taste almost exactly the same as eating in person at the restaurant!

On my recent visit to Las Vegas, White Castle was #1 on my list of tourist things to eat!!!  My brother has been to the ones on the East coast, so he told me they opened up the very first West coast WC on the Las Vegas strip a couple months ago.  To my surprise, it was just across the street from our hotel :D

I was very happy to discover that White Castle is open 24/7.   My first visit, was in the late afternoon, loooong lines, a bunch of loud drunk people, no where to sit, and crazy busy wait.   We opted to eat a quick snack instead at the little Footlong Hot dog place in Casino Royale, and came back next day 10am!!!  NO LINES and NOT crazy busy lol.  Definitely had to try the Double cheeseburgers, Onion strips and of course the crinkle fries.   I loved everything, Double cheeseburger was great, comes with the tiny onions and pickles, crinkle fries were great, and Onion strips were good.  I really didn't mind the prices, for my first visit, it was worth it.   I just want to say if you are a big eater, make sure you get yourself at least 4-6 cheeseburgers because they are tiny and won't fill you up compared to regular cheeseburgers elsewhere.  I think White Castle is more like a snack for some people...

Staff was very friendly and helpful, place was clean too!  I am really glad I had the opportunity to come here and try it out for myself.  It really was more about the experience and enjoying my vacation in Las Vegas.  Next time I come back, I'll try the chicken rings and loaded fries.   Menu is simple and easy to order from, and for drinks they have a fountain soda machine."
zsNPTVfZl_zaVtTDv7zhJQ,"I grew up eating White Castle in NYC since I was a toddler.  I live in Los Angeles now and when  go back to visit family in NY, I usually grab a few White Castle in The Bronx and get that great White Castle taste I grew up with.

Last week I went to this Las Vegas location and I'm sad to say I was disappointed in the food.  First of all, $3.59 for a double burger is just way over priced!  The White Castle locations I visit in NYC charge about $1.89 for a double.  I guess it being located on the strip is why the high cost?  I did notice the menu was a little different.  I don't think I saw fish sandwiches and I didn't see any fried clam strips.  And I'm fine with those menu differences.  I did like the onion sticks instead of the usual onion rings.  

My biggest issue was the flavor of the burgers.  They just don't taste as good as the White Castle I'm used to.  Despite them being made fresh at this location, they still taste similar to those terrible frozen ones you buy at the supermarket.   It's too bad because I was really excited to have a location out west."
q8EVqVzQMkQNmDnOcPlm0w,"Vegas Valentine's Day Adventure!

February 15, 2015

So lucky to have such an amazing boyfriend who planned the whole trip for us to eat in Vegas. Not only was I here for Shake Shack (my most favorite NY burger spot and the place I've been talking about for the past two and half years). 

So, after clubbing at Hakkasan, we went to get grub and feast on 30 burgers and two fries! Coming from a person who has never had White Castle, I loved it! The chicken rings burger was amazing too! After eating these, I wanted more and more the very next hour. 

Overall, spent $46 bucks on the food for two! 

Yes, he is perfect because we share our fatty side with each other"
vDA5sfcl0KmqATbuw6lpHw,"The burgers are gross. But it's super clean, and the chicken rings are.. Okay if you've got the munchies"
rK2v_MaQF1uVZhA2L5NcNg,"I've been wanting to try White Castle since seeing how satisfying it was to Harold and Kumar. Unfortunately, living in Northern California, I've never been able to try it until now. These burgers were some of the best I've ever had. The simple formula of meat, pickle, and grilled onions on a soft roll makes for some amazing eats. I recommend everyone try White Castle at least once."
YYBdTIQ1Q0INRE-NqNHCpw,"Disgusting... 

I'm quite the burger fanatic and review on yelp quite often. I usually stick to eating at gourmet burger joints, rather than getting the fast food type, however in Vegas I had the chance to visit White Castle, a place I've always wanted to try after watching the Harold and Kumar movies.. 

I was very shocked at the standard of meat being used in the burgers.. it looked inedible and made me want to feel sick at the site of it.. 

The cheese and onions being used looked burnt and plastic looking.. 

There was no sauces etc inside the burger it was plain and stale... 

The prices are cheap, however I feel this place is more for those who are heavily drunk or intoxicated by other means... 

I would never try White Castle again... 

I'm shocked this place hasn't been shut down."
uTOOroRn-fIKS0K4jzeDPw,I had my first experience at white castle and it was amazing.  I'm local and I will be back. Raul the representative that help me deserve kudos for excellent customer service that he provided.  I'll Definitely will return.  Keep up the good work.
_g_P7UoyymhmHD8KK2Amnw,"Yay White Castle!!! Boo for the long lines! Never stood in them but my coworkers have. Thank you to them cuz I hate waiting in line! Lol guess I've been lucky to have someone go for me since they offer to go... I'm such a brat... Lol anywho, these little sliders are pretty tasty... Soft warm buns, grilled diced onions, pickles and cheese... Melts in your mouth as soon as you bite into it... I like adding a little ketchup and mustard. I get full from eating four of them... But if your really hungry they sell'um by the case or even by the crate... If you have the munchies like Harold and Kumar head over to White Castle!!! Lol These little sliders will surely fill you up!!!"
U0dJp7knsNUOx1Jqpdgz6Q,"White Castle located inside The Casino Royal. Came to visit from Los Angles and saw there was a White Castle on the strip. Naturally,  we went to get stoned and came to grub.  The burgers tasted just like the frozen ones you buy at the store. Nothing extra,  nothing special. The experience was good and the woman that attended us was cheerful so it was cool over all.... I'd come back again, why not."
FqrBOiWtpc4UDVCev6Bk5Q,"Vacationing in Vegas, I got excited that i saw there was a White Castle located on the strip. For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way.  Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas.

While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a ""Harold and Kumar"" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?) Save your money for gambling or find a better adventure."
J3D5f0Rf2zFGn-_pX5hWQg,This place is awful!!! Whole family got sick from eating there. What type of meat is being used???
iEcC5g6bm6UKUAFrR1WRaA,0 stars barf. How can you even consider these burgers. I get the shivers every time I think about the unfortunate  time I ingested these appalling whatever they are. BARF!!!!!!!!!
M7Ilk0kw-DTpxeGfNBH2DA,I've loved white castle! They only sell them frozen or have fresh ones in the east coast. I finally get to try the fresh ones. So darn deliciously. I don't have to go to the east coast to get them. Very good! Will back again and again!). :)
O9oxV8s8ojD0P_o0IYGsQQ,"Brand new burger joint in Vegas. I have eaten White Castle before, in Detroit -- so when I made this special trip to the las vegas strip -- (park behind Walgreen's -- free parking sssshhh!!! and you're in/out anyways and if I felt guilty I would go into Walgreen's and buy a gum or anything I need, which I am sure I can think of something). But when I got to WC the line, well people are so excited about it right now -- the line was down the street at least 45 minute wait a worker told me at the door so, I snapped these pics and left. I may go back."
3cdRXZiBSXwQscQO4OwafQ,NAAAAAAAASTY!!! BURGERS tasted like paper! We were so disappointed! could honestly say we will NEVER eat there ever again.
x8QLkxW-TNfY4Pt-kVEeLw,"Oh how I've missed the original sliders from living in New York I used to get this tiny delicious melt in your mouth mini burgers!! I was extremely happy to be vacationing in Vegas & see that there've finally arrived on the west coast!!! 
Those who've written bad reviews obviously are those who probably eat at the Golden Arches & think that's good... From the smell & taste you can't go wrong here, with or without cheese love these little burgers!!! 
If your not a beef person check out the chicken rings trust you'll leave satisfied!!!
Love me some White Castle"
oxZvgXX9DOo10nFa9-E93Q,"It was my first time eating at White Castle. All I remember was eating the frozen stuff from the freezer aisle before this ever opened. I was sad coming here first because I don't eat red meat and I was just BLAH!!! Then, my friends said ""They have fish burgers, chicken.. I ordered so many for you!!!"" Seriously?! Harold and Kumar never promoted that in their movie!!! Hahaha! As you can tell, I had a little much to drink before eating but I was so excited after. It was delisshhhhh!!!!!! I was so happy.. I almost cried. I can officially say, I tried it! I think everyone should experience ""the hype"" and live up to that movie. Some will drive hours away for this, some will just walk from their hotel and devour it. I say, great experience! Pretty quick service too. I didn't order but it was fast haha! I would definitely go again if I end up wondering around the strip but it's rare I go. Just too crowded for me! Cheers and be safe my fellow yelpers. Eat on!"
9ywck1ar3fSYeGNXhjqKmQ,Haven't had White Castle burgers since I moved from NY. Burgers were ok but I encountered bubble guts within an hour after eating them. The taste  of these White Castle burgers isn't what I remembered. I will just buy the frozen one's next time.
1voxe84Q43DB8p7AaS8zqA,"This shit is disgusting!! 
I wanted to see what the hype was since they made a movie about it. Boy did it disappoint. Luckily there was no line or anything at 1am. The workers were quick and friendly but the burgers tasted exactly like the frozen ones and maybe even worst. 
Go to in n out when you want good tasting fast food burgers."
EkS4zjSy7MKP_m2HIpb2KA,"I was so excited that Whit Castle opened up a location closer to the west coast, so I definitely had to eat there on my next trip to Las Vegas.
My wife and I just recently visited this location on the morning of Friday 02/06/2014. We placed our order at the cashier and then head to the soda fountain to fill up our drinks. Before we are finished filling up our drinks, the man (5'8-5'10 with short hair) at the front counter is already calling out our number to pick up our order. I'm already trying my best and hurried up filling up our drinks so I can pick up the order. But within seconds after the first number call, the man at the front counter started to sound impatient and angry when he calls (yelling and screaming) out our number for the second and third time. I'm appreciative that they provide fast service on the orders, but the man really scared us and made us feel forced/rushed, it was very unprofessional!

Note (02/26/2015): This location barely just opened and it's the first location on the west coast, it's already at 2.5 star overall rating on Yelp, it's shameful and embarrassing."
NwU5_JkpdDueFjEHEnnj8w,"I don't understand what the hype is about. I ate here for the first time and I feel disgusted to have even put their food in my stomach. My group and myself felt so ill and bloated afterwards that we would all rather regurgitate the food than continue to walk around the strip with it in our stomachs. These sliders were soggy and terribly put together. The sliders you get back in middle school that were in a bag were way better than this. My fries either had the flu or were just old because they were pale and felt like rubber. If you are sober and looking for a decent meal to eat so that you can sight see, DO NOT EAT HERE! The food will make you sick. Never again. Best thing was the fountain drinks."
siq3ROaZ6HN-zPFfKGHN5g,"Pretty disappointing especially since it got so much hype from Harold and Kumar, but I had to try it when I saw that they had a location in Vegas.

You can buy sliders individually without a combo meal or without getting a 10 pack. I ordered 1 slider (just to try it) and the 9 piece chicken rings. Slider was about $1.29 each (which I'm told is more expensive than their usual locations, probably because it's Vegas).

Super disappointed. The whole slider can probably be ate in 1 bite and it just melts in your mouth in a bad way. You dont even need to chew. I'm all for soft buns, like shake shack buns, but this reminded me of wonder bread, which is probably as artificial as it gets... There's also little to no patty. Chicken rings were basically flattened out pieces of chicken cut into being shapes. They were like onion rings. You also have to ask them for ketchup.

Yeah, its probably the cheapest you can get in Vegas, but its also just low quality food that you should probably just skip. Only good thing is that you get your food fast after you order."
hPhvzLhQnrmxr0wDOvBJVQ,"Highly disappointed. I have been eating the frozen white castle burgers ever since I was a kid so I was super excited to finally try it unfrozen. I still liked it, however it tastes exactly the same as the frozen ones. Next time i'm gonna drive/walk the extra miles to go to shake shack because those burgers are 10x better!"
dTHtZkwsp_mCNOJ8lyaNww,Nothing special.  I wouldn't make a special trip.  Don't waist your time or your money. Maybe it's better on the east coast. Very disappointed
8ir-9Xpdrj4uwb7pwkaspQ,Soggy no flavor and the line is ridiculous also no where to sit down don't know what I was expecting eating sliders at the bar the other day ooh and they don't give you a refund only store credit if I'm returning my food it's because I don't like it I will not want to come back ever
jxZYwTb1VncMvV1mDUo5cg,"I never knew I could hate a burger so much. It was so greasy that it soaked the bun. The meat made McDonalds look bomb. Everything about the burger was unappealing.

I had to try this place just to see what Harold and Kumar chowed down on. I literally have no idea why it couldn't have been Harold And Kumar Go To Any Other Burger Place Cause White Castle Is Nasty.

Worst $1.00 I've ever spent in my life."
fA--7gEWhzozdUe4sHneLA,"I don't understand the hype, tastes like shit and it's crowded to the point where you fight for a table. It tastes like a double priced McDonald's. Imma go throw up now."
d4O7Lc-6ytnclK26YoCNEQ,"The first time I came to White Castle, the line was out the door.  I was excited to try the sliders!  After the first bite, I had no idea what the fuss is about.  The sliders are small and sad looking.  Not much flavor aside from the cheese.  And that's only if you get the cheeseburger sliders!  The original sliders are underwhelming.  The lines are seriously puzzling... is there a secret menu I'm not aware of?!  On the most recent, the hubs wanted to try the chicken rings.  It's a rip off. It's like a nugget, pounded super thin and then they punched a hole in the middle to make it a ""ring"".  Better off going to Shake Shack or even McDonald's dollar menu."
hfaE65xXnkGQhY5p_rrWYg,"For us West Coasters this is as close as we'll get to a White Castle with out taking a 4 hour flight.

My favorite is the chicken slider.  Its juicy, tender and delicious.  The regular sliders are good also.

My wife and I at here at around mid night on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy.  Expect to wait about 15 minutes for your food."
f0WsnlRFQ5yGOwPwjzddEA,"What's the big deal about this place.  Small burger, cheap cheese and no flavor.  This hamburger is like many new Yorkes that i know.  Small, tasteless but they  think they are the #!**^.  I need in and out now."
ElSkiydH4lPnKvGrPe60mQ,Just like back home no disappointment here bought a 10 pack and they didn't make it to the freeway home super yummy
ixrdmbcYcBPo7Kkmr7mAPQ,"I am from California  and Im super interested about White Castle's food. The tiny little burgers were alright and the onion fries were delicious! Overall it was a good experience, but there are many more burger places that surpass this place. I would like to mention that the staff here are excellent, the cashier helped us out choosing food since we didnt know what to get and was very kind and sweet. I dont remember his name, but we really appreciated his help!"
Mcd3WOe5qVLBqpQh8JyY_w,"Honestly not impressed. I've heard so much hype about their food and it really was no different then the cafeteria that is at my university. also, they messed up my order. i understand that times can get busy, but when i show up and there are only 4 people in line i would hope i can get the right order. Also, I'm not sure how good i feel about eating chicken that is in the shape of a ring LOL,  something tells me chickens don't grow like that."
9lWFyd5ecGJojd3NpfnGsA,Didn't have to wait in line. Staff was friendly. Food was delicious even it was small portions. Price was reasonable for the quality of food and portion size. Food was made fresh and when order can see the process going into it. When purchase drink the fountain is accessible to you during the time you stay and eat. Would  recommend it if you like slider and burger. Would come back and dine in again.
h5k4N753Q9Pw1lpGGM0Xzg,"It took way too long for the strip to get a White Castle, but Im glad it came.  We stopped in at a typical White Castle dining time (3 am) and it was packed so we almost left, but they did a pretty good job of getting the food out there quickly, so it was well worth the wait.  
It is too expensive though, I know its the strip, but its still White Castle, come on!"
lCrCyNw_M99asFz5VyX5Hw,"White Castle isn't for everyone as you can see from some of the reviews, but if you have fond memories of them and haven't lived near one for years, this location delivers. As a midwesterner transplanted to SoCal I looked forward to trying them again on my visit to Vegas and it lived up to expectations. Line was extremely long and like everything else on The Strip it's a bit overpriced, but it will satisfy a slider craving."
xJqBGcDX_QFzZUEt81YByQ,"It's White Castle. 

Shit is steamed delicious goodness. The Ritz it ain't but what else do you want? They serve glasses of beer and they are connected to the slot area of a hotel.

It is my humble opinion that this is a combination for success. Also, the line moves pretty quickly."
CcnxlklXtP3YB5WmorxO7w,"I give them 3 stars because the food is to my liking; however, there are a few things that I don't like about this place...
1). You have to park at a hotel and walk through the casino to get out to the strip to do some more walking just to get to the place. (walking I don't mind so much, good exercise - trying to keep a positive mindset especially if you're eating junk food lol)
2). When you do finally get there, you have to wait in line and depending on when the tables are cleared/available and how many people you have with you (besides how packed they are) will determine how long you wait until you get inside - only to have to wait in another line to order your food.
3). They dont have an extras section on the menu - for example if you want to add an extra slider to your combo. 
4). If you're sitting by the door of the entrance to the place, during the Volcano show at the Mirage hotel across the street, you can feel the heat blowing at you when the door is open. (Im not a fan of heat; and yes Im aware I live in Vegas lol)
***Lastly, I hope they open more locations so for some of us locals who tend to avoid the strip wont have to go to there. As good as the food was, the traffic on the strip, parking at the hotel, and dealing with all the tourists is enough to keep me away."
iNuaSzHiFdfP631hg72CfQ,"Having been dubbed as 'gut bombers' by friends from the Midwest, I should have known better not to dive straight into the pits of hell.  Unfortunately, the term still holds true despite of being in this side of the country!  Engorged 3 sliders and things began to go downhill from there.  I'd like to keep this review as clean as possible so look up reviews on Amazon regarding sugar-free Haribo gummy bears to give you a better idea of what actually went down.  If this were your first time, consider yourself warned and eat at your own risk!

After hearing about the grueling wait in line for the past several days following its grand opening, we came in around 4 o'clock Sunday morning thinking there wouldn't be anyone in the establishment.  Instead, we walked in to one of the worst mistakes we've done in awhile.  To our surprise, the place itself was swarming with drunk people from nightclubs around the area.  It almost felt like a nightmare coming in sober; as if someone was about to get shot/stabbed at any moment.  At least you can get $1 beers from the bar right across the fast food joint to help you get acclimated with the whole scene if you happen to find yourself in the same situation.  

We ended up waiting for over 50 minutes just to order and another 15 to get our food.  The sliders were just as good when I had it in Chicago.  For those having it for the first time, however, they're fairly similar from what you can get at Costco.  This might even be worse as they were rather cold once I started eating them.

Overall, White Castle is definitely bringing in the masses for their infamous sliders.  As much as I'd like not to come back at this establishment, I can see my inebriated self lining up in the near future just to get a hold of their greasy sliders to help soak up the alcohol."
D97UapIW-seReMGi4haIfA,I'm completely in love with this place but you won't be full unless you spend at least 20$. So satisfying especially after watching Harold and Kumar and the place is open 24/7!
GkXrLkJ_hWjEmGoc2nPz7A,"Damn you, Harold and Kumar for hyping up this place! I was hoping that when I ate it fresh, it would taste better than the frozen ones you can buy at the supermarket... I was wrong, they taste the SAME. My friend warned me and told me it tastes like cardboard. I wouldn't go to that extreme, but I probably wouldn't go back. It's really not that cheap for small burgers and mediocre fries. If I'm comparing cheap fast food burgers, I prefer McDonalds."
yNmgw23M00J4BLeZ3O0Obw,Ummm...yeah...so I expected WAY more from this place. Considering all the hype this place gets in comparison to In N Out. The flavors were ok but the bun was so soggy and it didn't remotely taste fresh. Sadly will definitely not be coming back here again.
nNufUPtMKmP7Hd9-IAeixw,"First time having White Castle in a few years and it was a disappointment, burgers taste like the microwaveable ones you can buy at the grocery store each tiny burgers were about over $1 in n out is way better!"
Jq5VF3DZmnWVuRBdYCEKFA,Decided to take a bunch home for my son and nephew. Haven't had these lil gems since I lived back East and now that the lines have gone down figured why not. Lil pricey to feed 3 persons and to be honest not as tasty as I remember them to be. Not much difference from the frozen ones at the grocery store. Ok if you're in the area otherwise I wouldn't make a special stop.
ZmV4SO04-xC2Q_98cRbTVQ,finally tried this place out. the food is way overpriced for what you get. low quality overpriced. first time is the last time.
1cshUxcpxDj8rEIxnJu98g,"It's White Castle!!!

After moving out of Michigan White Castle is hard to come by, besides frozen and those are just not right!

This curbed the ""crave"" while being in Las Vegas. Yes, the prices are higher...it's Vegas!!
The lady behind the register was lovely, polite, and patient while we got our order together.
The food was served quickly.....not usually the case at most White Castles! Burgers were what we expected but the chicken was full of grizzle and had me very dissatisfied in that department.
Yes, it was dirty and the drink station a mess but there was a worker cleaning. I chalked that up as that they were busy. Management probably needs to put someone in the seating area cleaning at all times just to keep up on the traffic and mess!

Would I go back....if in Vegas again.... Well Yes.....It's White Castles!!!"
qcDl6VeqjuTk-tSGwSHcDg,"The sliders were ok, due to the cool little box the bun got kinda mushy, other than that the chicken rings were really good, I think eating here is more to say I got to eat at White Castle rather than going for the actual food its self"
qC2cnrQSNWOBZpnnGHTU5g,I just don't get this place.  I think it's a nostalgia thing for midwesteners but as a west coast person I don't get it.
g0GuYEg-bCrNHMZViS_s0Q,"I came to White Castle with my cousins who were excited to try it out as they had been to White Castle locations when they lived on the East Coast but could not find any of its locations in LA. The beauty of the strip is that you could be eating gourmet burgers from super star chefs one day and sliders from the freezer section of your local grocery store the next. As expected we ordered a bunch of stuff like original sliders, cheese sliders, onion rings, curly fries, chicken nuggets etc. The onion rings and chicken nuggets were outright nasty. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of those. The sliders specially the cheese slider was surprisingly very good. The buns were nice and soft without any sogginess. The pickles, cheese and patties came together very well. I chomped on six of these bad boys with ease so definitely order a bunch of them to fill you up.

What I like about White Castle is that it does not try to be something that it is not. It is located opposite to one of the seediest dive bars that you will find on the strip and below a dumpy hotel both of which I have had the good fortune of sampling. Been there, done that, have no intention of repeating."
JS-7tDWdLU19v74UF6V-PQ,"After eating this fake meat, complete with holes so u get even less, I realize that in the Midwest they must not have a lot to choose from to go on about this place. I will never go back."
5oAPniQ9lIJz2fkavO7n1A,"As far as my first White Castle experience goes...I don't remember much of it. It's conveniently located on the strip to catch all the intoxicated folk walking by. 

It was pretty decent food, but I wasn't expecting the sliders to hold a thin sandwich like meat instead of an actual patty. Also, the fries were a bit too crispy for my liking.

On the other hand, the service was pretty quick and I can't complain about what I ate after leaving the club--I was full at the end of the night, and that's really all the matters at the end of the that kind of night."
M8AYPrmZtWkZHdublM0b-g,"First time ever at a white castle. Was pretty average. It was busy, but what do you expect on the strip. Burgers were good to soak up the booze at the end of the night. Would go again because the price is right for were it's located. Just expect to wait in line for awhile."
q5if2SG-EqRJgZJOfVVvDw,"Late night muchies! Why? Because they're open all day! 
food was descent nothing really special except it's WHITE CASTLE!!! so if u want to try the famous place ; this is the place!"
etBx_1ZYKNI4OSNjy7VfVA,"I'm not a big fan of fast food, it's so unhealthy for you. When you're hungry and have limited options then maybe. If you're walking the strip, you're been drinking and hungry then White Castle is a must! It's a newer spot on my way back to my hotel so I figured, why not? What you eat in Vegas, stays in Vegas. 

Since it's only sliders, I ordered a variety so that I can get my White Castle fix. My favorite was the Jalapeño Cheese Sliders. It wasn't spicy at all just in case you don't like spicy foods. The patty on the sliders are very thin and I recommend getting the doubles. White Castle has a nice twist of an onion ring with their Onion Chips. It wasn't bad and complimented the sliders well. 

The staff here is what you expect from a fast food restaurant but the customers are interesting. It ranges from the very drunk, drunk, families to completely sober people. Luckily they have ample tables and seating in their dining area. It could be cleaner but you have to option to take out. For me, I'm glad this experience stayed in Vegas."
tpsekFIaUL6MpTaaqAv27w,"The vegetarian burgers are HORRIFIC. Literally horrific. It's a bun with a small veggie Pattie in it, no toppings, no sauce, no cheese, no NOTHING. We drove way too far for us to go back and ask for toppings on a burger, but who in the hell puts NOTHING on a burger!?

**Edit: I ordered one sweet chili veggie burger and one ranch veggie burger.... Neither of which had anything but bread and a veggie pattie. Also, onions and pickles are vegan and come on all of your other burgers (FYI to the business owner who wanted to mention that cheese isn't vegan, as if this somehow remedies the situation or amounts to any sad excuse for customer service)**"
TR9NjfHWTYxzAAwdTkHOeA,"Trash food, trash service. Ate here for the second and LAST time last week. First time was last summer. Only reason I went back was because my friend had never tried them before and he will agree when he said ""that food was pretty wack."" After waiting over 10 minutes to get our food, (which was to be expected as I learned from my first visit since they can be pretty busy at times) our fries were cold and stale. I was so hungry though that I ate my 5 sliders before going back up to the counter to tell them about the fries. The manager tells me ""you ordered almost 20 mins ago and now you tell me about the fries?...of course they're cold"". Yeah we ordered 20 minutes ago, we hadn't had our food for 20 mins. I could not believe the audacity of this idiot. I told her they were cold and stale when she gave them to us and I wasn't going to argue with a fast food employee. As a manager she should've been accommodating especially since we just spent close to $30. I told her she could keep her fries, left them on the counter, and left. White Castle food is trash and their management reflects their product. I will NEVER waste my $$ or time there again."
LfY7kEps_rQQAgnZyRIRdg,Can I review this place a billion times so it receives 5 stars?! Place is amazing!!! These burgers are little morsels that melt in your mouth!!! They have cool beer cups and the service is good!! Love it
fuA5oQuv2mEXL_H_otB5EA,"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 54/100***

You know what they say... when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Since we were staying on the strip for a 3 day staycation we planned on finally trying White Castle and cross it off our list. Personally I have had no urge to try this popular east coast chain but the hubby was adamant in trying it at least once. Ummmm NO, not going back. Lol. 

After trekking the unforgiving 110 degree Vegas heat from the Flamingo, we arrived at the very well lit White Castle space inside the Casino Royale. The area is decorated modestly and everywhere you looked was clean hence the extra star because reality is, all I can give for the quality food wise is 1 star.

We ordered 2 cheese slider combos ($8.99 each) which consisted of: 4 cheese sliders, regular size fries and a drink; Large order of the onion chips ($2.99) the buy 'em by the sack which had 10 original sliders. All that set us back $32+ after the 10% local discount they gave us. The first couple of bites were okay but it was downhill after that, I had 3 sliders and I was fighting to down it. The middle was somewhat soggy which was very unsettling, the taste is indescribable but not in a good way. The fries and onion chips have nothing going on for them either, nothing to write home about. My daughter who likes cheeseburger barely finished one, my husband had the same sentiments, after his third one he was done. My son is the only one that liked it. I told him he can come with his cousins if the mood strikes him because there is no way you can ever bring me back here, it's just not worth the calories. White Castle, check, on to the next adventure."
a0wXqSKjIG3Ww1yzAm27tA,"I was real stoked to hear that White Castle opened up on the strip. And since we were gonna be in town for the big fight weekend, I was hyping up getting a crave case at some point during the weekend. Good thing it's open 24 hours but its location is a little tricky in that you really have to be in the immediate area and just walk over because it's smack dab in the middle of the strip by Harrah's and across the street from the Mirage... I was bummed to find out that this particular White Castle location does not offer the bacon-cheese slider or the jalapeno one. LAME. The bacon and cheese one is so good. Whenever one of my relatives flies to LA from Queens they bring a crave case of that goodness but none in Vegas?? That alone is worth the deduction of 2 stars.

We got there after spending a few hours at Omnia nightclub and were all starving. Luckily the line wasnt too long. We only waited about 10-15 mins before we ordered. As soon as we sat down, the line was crazy... We ordered a crave case. That's 30 sliders. We got half classic and the other 15 with cheese. We got 4 orders of large fries and sodas. The sodas are refillable so that's good. The crinkle cut fries are decent. Some are crispy. Others were a little soggy. The sliders which I was so looking forward to were a little disappointing. Not because bacon wasnt an option but they just didnt taste as good as I remember. The weird thing was the original ones without the cheese were tastier than the ones WITH cheese. They seemed to have way more of the grilled/steamed onions on the originals than the cheese slider. The difference in taste was significant. And I was pretty disappointed... Dont get me wrong. I still scarfed down about 6 of them bad boys but I had no choice, I was starving. But I was still disappointed because I couldnt figure out how the sliders hand-carried on the plane ride from Queens and reheated in the microwave were better than the ones right off the grill in front of me. Puzzling... I hope it improves because if someone like me whose ""lightly"" familiar with the White Castle menu is disappointed, what more for someone that's a tried & true Craver. Harold & Kumar would not approve...

Funny story... As we were finishing up. A slightly tipsy and partied-out couple who didnt want to wait in the long line for their food offered us $10 for 2 sliders... SOLD. To the lush couple... Only in Vegas.

Service was ok. Definitely no enthusiasm from the cashier that helped us. Theyre probably over it with the characters they see on the daily... Be better White Castle Las Vegas. You should be better than that.

ps - cousins from Queens brought over a crave case a couple of weeks after this trip and sure enough, they were tastier. taste comparison complete... I was right. Vegas needs to step it up."
4QDH--0qaDk_DqHplhLJ2Q,"I finally got to try this hype machine and meh is right!

I've been wanting to check out White Castle ever since I saw the first Harold and Kumar movie. After my recent visit, its clear to me that you have to be stoned out of your mind to enjoy this place.

Located in the decrepit Casino Royale, this White Castle is probably the main reason people even step inside this place. WC takes up a pretty big amount of real estate in the casino but don't expect to find seating or quick service. Being the only Castle on the West Coast means this place is packed; lines are long, service is poor and its not rare to see people fighting over a seat in the dining area. If you must come here, parking at Harrahs next door or Mirage across the street should be sufficiently close.

The food here from my understanding is essentially the same as it's East Coast counter parts plus a few bucks cause you are eating on the Strip. The tiny sliders come with a paper thin slice of beef, a few grilled onions and a soggy bun due to the grease. The crinkle cut fries can be found at many other mediocre fast food spots. Skip the chicken rings and go buy some frozen nuggets from Costco, you will thank me later. The food is definitely over priced, a four slider combo with cheese runs for $9. Service was abysmal and place was a mess.

While waiting in line, the party in front of us was talking about how they grew up on White Castle in New York and how excited they were to finally eat here again. I guess nostalgia must be the only way to really appreciate White Castle. Oh and maybe after smoking a bunch of weed."
cRtzGeVI704c_blx0hJovg,"This is as good as it gets late night noshing. They don't look great, the location is small and weird right inside of the gross Casino Royale, everyone inside is plastered, and it just doesn't matter. When your number is called and those little boxes of heaven are handed over, all the pain in the world goes away and the most amazing flavor of deliciousness is all that matters.

I suggest getting doubles; double the meat, double the cheese, double the fun! I just prefer the extra meat and gooey cheese to bun ratio better than the singles. I also prefer the jalapeno cheeseburgers to the regular ones. It is not a spicy jalapeno flavor at all, just a little kick to let you know it's there. Just an added bonus for who like a little spice.

There's not much more to say. If you're looking for a gourmet burger, this is not it. But if it's late, you've lost some money at the tables, and you just want something delicious to chomp on, this is the place. The lines can get long, but who cares? It's Vegas. Grab a drink and relax. What are you in such a hurry for anyway?

SIDE STORY: My wife got hit on right in front of me and I still didn't care. White Castle. That's all that matters. She stayed with me."
whz1dQ2b8ZQ9c4FEknNklw,Disappointed I thought it would be way better then the microwavable Frozen ones... taste the same
KV1xSxZBgYe97cg4n89ipg,"White Castle is just another east coast burger joint that doesn't quite do it for me. My boyfriend and I came around 11 PM after watching a show since we knew the wait during the day would just be ridiculous. Thankfully we were right and the line was pretty short (25 mins) compared to what other people experienced. The line starts outside on the sidewalk and is pretty well manned and serviced by security guys. 

On to the food. I wasn't that hungry but my boyfriend decided to ""Buy 'em by the sack"" since this is probably the last time we would be coming here unless we were super drunk and stumbled down this way again. The menu says 10 original sliders but they will put cheese on as many of them as you like which costs you a bit extra. We also got extra grilled onions (which can be added for free). The crinkle cut fries were good but don't think they were any different than ones you get from other fast food joints (just a bit more soggy). The sliders with the cheese were definitely better. They may not seem that big but you can tell you are just putting a whole load of grease down into your stomach.

Onto the aftermath of eating those sliders...man what are those things actually made of! The next morning I was soooooo gassy! So I'm not sure what those tiny little meat patties are made of or how much oil and grease is used to make the burger but man that was noooot pleasant. All in all I probably won't be coming back anytime soon, at least not sober. It's definitely a place to try just because of it's notoriety from the east coast but don't wait in line if it's over 30 minutes! You will be disappointed!"
TuI8fhaBG2yMJLigB9hwQQ,"Being from the West Coast, the first time I heard of White Castle was watching that Harold-and-Kumar-get-really-high-and-need-to-fix-their-munchies movie. After that, I noticed that you could buy them frozen in the supermarket and defrost them to get a fix. When I heard an actual location opened up in Vegas, I made it a point to get there eventually. It took me 3 trips to Vegas to finally go because I was scared away by the potential crowds.

Well, it finally happened. It's located on the outskirts of Casino Royale on the strip, really easy to find by foot.

I came on a Wednesday around 11 am. There was a very short line but the seating area was pretty full. I asked the cashier when it starts getting crazy, and she told me after noon. A hot tip for you guys, earlier is better. The service was great, and the seating area was clean.

I ordered ten sliders with cheese, onion rings, and fries. The fried stuff was meh but the sliders were delicious. Meat, cheese, onion, and a soft roll. They taste better than the frozen ones because they're cooked fresh. The difference isn't that noticeable though. 

Verdict: I love their sliders. I don't care that they're mostly bread with very little meat. I'm not coming here to be healthy. 

Note: They have cheesecake on a stick. I regret not getting it. They also sell beer."
SquhFCd0l0Q-jA4Utiwb4g,"Having never been to the east coast, I wanted to give these guys a whirl. $8.99 got me 4 cheeseburgers, fries, and a soda. I scarfed those bad boys down and thought they weren't half bad. Couple days later I got the 2 dbl chs w fries and soda for $7.99 but thought the middle bun was too squishy and unnecessary. Not much of a line, pretty quick service, what could be better?"
m-OYE9Zgp7Oln4eQCbwB7A,"This White Castle seems to be more expensive than in Chicago but I guess we're paying for convenience. It was clean and nice and you can watch your food being prepared. The food didn't really stand out as it was fast food overall, but I'd come again if I was craving their famous sliders. FYI it is $1.29 for each burger slider and you'll want to eat a couple as they aren't that filling."
pxVVDLkQhhRdwfuHUYrIWw,"It's as good as White Castles found back east.  If you loved them there, you get the same ones here.  If you have never had them before, like my California friends you might not like them.  A guy who works at a hotel here said they aren't as good as Jersey, then said that in n out is not good either and he prefers Sonic.  I think his taste buds have died, and there is NO way he is from Jersey."
PON4QeQmvA8ud5BOhZnZMA,"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- we had just eaten and were just strolling along down The Strip, when we stumbled onto this place
- if you don't know who Harold & Kumar are, then don't talk to me

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):
- clear windows allow you to easily see how packed this place is!

THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):
- limited and narrow seating
- with the limited space that this place has, it's pretty good on the traffic line for those awaiting to order

THE MENU:
- castle combos
- castle packs
- bigger cravings
- sliders
- sides
- dessert on a stick
- beverages
- breakfast

WHAT WE ORDERED:
- the original slider
- cheese slider
- french fries
- onion chips

THE LOOK/TASTE:
- the packaging is so cute! 
- the sliders were good! 
- the french fries were basic
- the onion chips were ok, i prefer them to be in rings

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- fast
- polite enough, considering the high volume of customers"
_3t-8SCTIAzlwmT2ZgNLoA,Good Mini burger with lots of fresh onions can't get enough of these burgers yummy I can't wait to go back will tell all people in California
OipOYaf-jDO_KRIIOKpeRw,"I used to hear my friend talk about eating at White Castle. He was so hype about it. So once I saw this, I had to go try it. Service was great. Food was prepared quick. I ordered the double slider, cheese slider, and a fish slider. Size is your typical small slider size; smaller than a McDonalds. The food was just plain. Your bun, cheese, meat, pickles, onions? and that's it. If there was sauce, I couldn't taste it. Good thing they offered condiments like ketchup, mayo, mustard, ranch, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, zesty sauce, hot sauce, etc. Mayo went well with the fish slider I got. Honey mustard went well with the double slider. All in all, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I don't want to have to add my own sauce... Well, at least I tried it..."
gF8No4sOY3cOJ-egkk7VDg,"What a disappointment! If you have visited the original locations in Illinois, do yourself a favor a STAY AWAY from this place. Grease-drenched, bland flavors reign supreme here, so no matter what you get you won't care for it much. The long lines, and the smoke stench that linger into the dining room from the casino floor, makes the experience really sub-par. I will wait to have another White Castle burger until I go back to the midwest."
U0oQ1ITjz1JXoqqr8AC5iQ,I hate the fact that I have to give a star in order to do a review. The food here was absolutely disgusting! They call those burgers that was the thinnest piece of meat I have ever seen. Not only did the food taste nasty but almost made me want to throw up so I can rid myself from the horrible taste that haunted my mouth after the food that I tried to eat from there. What a Waste of money.  Not only that but it took way too long to get my food and the constant yelling of numbers made the atmosphere unbearable. First time here at this place and definitely will be my last time. You have been warned: don't ever eat here!
Ku10BuAjEh_pmkIJj7OVDw,"Great things come in little packages...

I love me some White Castle!!  I've been to multiple locations on the east coast, and wish they would come to Cali, but Vegas is close enough for now.

Having the cheeseburgers made fresh are 20x better than the frozen ones. Hands down, my favorite tasting fast food cheeseburger. I love the Hawaiian style sweet bread for a bun, the grilled chopped onions, the juicy flavor of the meat and the melted cheese. The chicken was juicy and tender and the breading was a little crunchy. Mmmmmm so good for a quick bite to eat. Many people come here to try the burgers and complain that they are small. Duhhh, they are called cravings because they are small slider type mini burgers. Either way, I love their burgers, and am glad to see a closer location. 

This location has beer, soda, donuts, fries, burgers with and w/out cheese, and chicken sandwiches. The line was long when I arrived, but moved really quick. The food was ready within 4 minutes and there was plenty of seats inside. We enjoyed our food before we continued walking, and took the 4 cheeseburgers we had left for later. 

Whenever I am in Vegas, you can guarantee I will stop by."
opWrdONTiMez_qj9I9MR5w,Overrated ...two stars because the line was long but they work fast and have a system... Not sure how the original White Castle taste like but the meat looks like thinly sliced mystery meat with soaked grilled onions and one pickle.... If you must try at least get the cheese slider the cheese gives some flavor.
0Lfd2SwAH19FyHrf7crkow,"Of course I had to go to White Castle! Reliving the good old days...
""... just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers with those little, itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one... just makes me want to burn this motherfucker down. Come on, Pookie, let's burn this motherfucker down! Come on, Pookie! Let's burn it, Pookie! Let's burn this motherfucker down! Let's burn it down! Let's burn it!

iuVS_AmZUONL_0MzMPOlHw,"Being a west coaster all my life I was of course excited to try the infamous White Castle.  Boy was I disappointed, probably the worst fast food I've ever had. The sliders were disgusting and the chicken rings we are par with the frozen dinosaur chicken nuggets my nephew eats."
MrYnCrUYXLRsYk2mXAZN6A,"Average place to get a burger...... a slider, it's your classic New Yorker feel. Grab yourself a six pack and roam the strip!"
r8gUEcZp7yZebfglUCkSTg,Nothing special about White Castle burgers. It was very pricey for small simple cube-shape burgers. It was worth the try but something I wouldn't eat again. We ordered number 7 with cheese for extra $3. The late night crowd is not a pleasant so I recommend anyone with little kids to go somewhere else.
kloRfnnrU_DowHNSl1trhA,"This place is over hyped and not worth filling up your stomach with, and emptying out your wallet for.  Be prepared to be greeted by two security guards as you enter the front door.  Expect two to four more security guards in the tiny, cramped dining establishment.  That is not intimidating at all.  

The GF and I ordered a slider and fries.  I saw them putting pickles on the slider and knew this would be a no go for her.  Sadly, the cashier had already rung us up.  It took an awkward 2-3 minutes for him to refund and re-swipe my credit card.  Sure, it is my fault for making him go through all that trouble. But, could he not have simply told the person making the sliders to not add pickles?  

A minute or two after being witness to sheer incompetence, our number is called.  I guess in all the confusion, they forgot to put fries in the bag (even though I was charged for it).  

Despite being the only one in line to order, I feel this place can be described as chaotic.  There were so many employees at work.  There must have been hundreds of sliders already pre-cooked and just hanging out, waiting for someone to buy them.  Freshness is definitely not a high concern amongst them.  

Now on to the actual taste of the slider and fries.  The slider was nothing special.  It tastes like an exact replica of the microwavable ones.  The fries were average at best.  They taste so plain, and crispiness is word miles away from the texture of them.  

Yelpers, you have been warned.  Proceed at your own risk.  If you are drunk, by all means, you will absolutely love it here.  If you have standards, please head to our friend Ronald."
xqLlTuQ_qFxDJaphUWXWmQ,"White Castle has always been on my bucket list, thanks to Harold and Kumar. 
Last time my family and I visited Las Vegas, my brothers went and raved so much about the place. So we just went and honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about the place. The burgers itself were kind of dry but I really did like the grilled onions in it. I just think if there was some sort of sauce in the burgers, it would've been much better. I was expecting much more. 
However, the price wasn't that bad. We got the combo with 20 burgers and two fries and it cost $25. So that wasn't bad at all. 
Overall, I'm glad I got to go to the place for the experience but I'm not keen on going back anytime soon."
VV6_-Pu6yIN2igbj9Hf9Lw,"I understand they have just branched out to the west coast. Buuuuut.... This is not a ""full"" White Castle menu. No fish sandwiches. The only reason I eat there. I hope to see more options next time I'm in Vegas. For now I will travel back home to NJ for my White Castle fix."
XhJvLGORgHTda9op6Uf1ew,"The same experience I get every year I come to Vegas. Except this time I ventured out a little and tried the Fish and Chicken slider. OH MY LORD THEYRE SO GOOD. The fish slider IS better than McDonalds Filet o Fish! Like whaaaaat?! The chicken slider was the right amount of crispiness and juicy and so was the fish slider. I got the double cheese slider as well and it was meh, I'm not a fan of White Castles Original, Classic, nor Cheeseburgers.. they're just too mushy for me and they smell weird. $10 for 1 double cheese slider, 1 fish slider, 1 chicken slider, and 1 soft drink.

I'll be back for the chicken and fish sliders! The Fried Onion Chips were actually pretty good too!"
HCrGeIgG6LZCC8qHVcr5aA,sad to say but the microwave burgers from costco tatsted better then what i experienced here. jerome was the most rude and disrespectful person i have ever dealt with...... will never come back here..... sad over all...
Uj3qQEX4NKHmxNzJ-kQ6eg,"I've been coming here since I found out about this place! And I love the burgers and the mozzarella sticks. I love coming here because they're always so friendly. The only thing I didn't like this time was that the table were super dirty. Another thing was that there was an employee fighting with a guest telling him to leave. The manager came and told the guy to leave and he said ok. And then then the employee left and came back and started telling the guy inappropriate stuff. That was unnecessary drama, but I still love the burgers !"
KXiv8FdgcfOaMf0qITN58Q,"All HYPE!

I was walking the strip and happen to walk past a sign that said White Castle. I look up and behold its a White Castle restaurant. I immediately walk inside. Take a look at the menu. All I see is these mini burgers. Anyways i went and ordered a combo. 4 small mini burgers fries and a drink. Service was fast. Line got back up but they are quick. Got my food. Had to find a spot to eat since the whole place was pack. This location is a gold mine for white castle. All the tourist walking by get lured in. 

Burgers was okay. Fries was generic. All this hype for some small burgers made famous by a movie. 

Give it a try. Only will try once again if a friend choose to eat here. 

Nothing special! Move along!"

I moved to California a few years ago and have been dying for white castle. I took a star off simply because they DON'T HAVE CLAM STRIPS! I was a bit heartbroken...still kinda am. Where are my sack of clam strips with my crave case?!"
kV3zbAcSoFwWWT_beFLJZw,I don't know what all these people are complaining about. The food was delicious. They make the onion rings different but still good. My only issue is the lack of seating for larger and handicapped people. So from now on I'll just get it to go. And they need some big red. That's the best to wash it down with.
Pp709GQ0eXPN7QYdvVR-mw,"I'm so impressed. Never would have come here! Drunken night, hungry....that's the place to go. John is a riot! The staff is incredibly friendly and patient. Chicken ring sandwich added pickle and onion...mmmmhhhhh! And bathrooms are 10 feet away, important in Vegas ;)"
KY3gD1hnLXtclStUi1tEPA,Definitely love their sliders. The prices are very reasonable. I also got their loaded fried which were bomb I don't even really know what was in it but it was good. I only gave it 4 stars because when we ordered they had forgot to give us our chicken rings and it was already too late to go back and get them because we were so far so that sucked. But other than that great food. It's open 24 hours so it's good for when you just get out the club you can go here lol
Ssfdnb9F-b_38_JBbPHd-w,Buns seem to be steamed better than when I first came. Still disappointed with not having onion rings and clam strips on the menu.
ncv-H1qst4Llto6ouhFAtg,"I've never had White Castle and when I saw it on the strip and it was close by our hotel, I decided to stop in.  The line up was long and took about 20 minutes from entering to leaving with my food.  I'm not familiar with their sliders so I decided to get 3 of them and a regular fries.  I thought if I couldn't eat them all, I would share with my husband.  The line up to order was the longest wait, but the cashier was friendly.  After I waited on the side for my order number to be called.  It seems to be an efficient process with staff doing their part of the assembly line to get the food ready and placed in bags.  The woman who calls out the number also provides ketchup packets and is friendly.

When I got back to the hotel, I was disappointed with the food.  Each slide had a pickle and onions but the beef didn't look and taste very appetizing.  I was hungry so I did eat up eating all my food but now that I've tried it once, I know I never have to go back.  There's too many other great restaurants and food to be had in Vegas so I'll keep walking by next time I'm in the area."
0-0MCLN-goMCBEae55Nk3A,Super fast service and very friendly staff. I've been craving fresh sliders since I left the US midwest. Been eating the frozen sliders since there's no White Castle where I'm from. It was just as delicious as I remembered and of course tasted better than the frozen ones. I'm so happy someone opened a White Castle in Vegas!
AWWgUpNh7qLvFcvGQOX4qA,I wish I could give this place 0 stars. The food was so gross. The frozen ones are actually better then these. They have no flavor at all. After eating the first slider I started to feel sick and the 4 security guards all over the place makes it feel like we are being timed on how fast you eat so you can leave. There was no seating at all either.
tblyaIt1gTC9EES20ieOog,"Grew up in CA and hadn't tried one before, and now I wish I had kept it that way. I ate two sliders and got a super super upset stomach for the next full 24 hours. It ruined a whole day of my trip. Worst part is that the food is on par with McDonalds so defs wasn't worth any aspect of the hell I went through the next day. Avoid at all costs! Go to Chipotle if you want something filling/fast and cheap."
Lg09QQ1EsZkKp_LS2ygRog,I finally made it out to white castle. Being able to eat the burger of my childhood fresh rather than frozen was like a dream. It's scary how close the taste is though. Nothing beats a fresh slider. Especially one with jalapeño cheese. Total game changer. Glad I got to make it out here and will continue to eat white castle whenever I can.
FpsxelWhdca-MKvTh_LSVA,"Okay I was just strolling down memory lane and 5 W.C.B.s later (W.C.B. = White Castle BURGERS I refuse to call them ""sliders"")I had successfully completed my flash back to the early 90's, and the last time I went to a White Castle. The one closest to my Pennsylvania home closed due to fire, and I had since moved to Vegas."
S3ZwbxXEeTNR_Ck8eT15-w,"Love me some White Castle! Am originally from Michigan but now live in Virginia where there are none.  So happy to find a oasis in the desert with White Castle on the strip! 

Sliders and onion chips as good as I remember and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Added bonus is this location serves beer and is also open 24/7.  
I'll be back!"
ejfyzV4_NJeD1LfyrI0jPw,Came in at 7 am and there werent a lot of customers yet but my cousins and I are were very excited nontheless! Workers were very nice and sweet considering it was super early! Very quaint and clean environment! The portions are a bit tiny so you are gonna want more! Overall I loved it! I will be coming back!!
i8fpzvdqGFesF3Ye-xkStA,Food was alright. I don't understand all the hype. The pricing wasn't bad at all considering it's on the strip. I would go back. My children really enjoyed themselves
C36ujYeKf33sSpvVZj-xYg,"Hellooooooo White Castle! I've been waiting for you to come to the West Coast (or as close as can be to the West Coast) since the Harold and Kumar movie. Yes, it's been THAT long. -_- And those White Castle sliders in the frozen aisle of the grocery store do not do it justice! Located in the Best Western Casino Royale, in between Venetian and Harrah's, they're open 24/7, perfect for late night munchies and as expected for a Vegas spot! There's a direct entrance off the strip so you don't have to go through the casino floor. The direct entrance takes you through the dining area first while you make your way back to the counter to queue up and order. 

BF went all out for 2 people and got the #9 combo pack, which includes 20 original sliders and 2 orders of french fries. Just 10 sliders short of a crave case cardboard box, which meant our order was packed slightly discreetly in a paper bag with a plastic bag instead. LoL. Sliders come with bun, patty, pickle, and onions. Cheese is an extra $6 (about 33 cents per slider) for the #9 combo and was well worth it! I bit into the slider with low expectations because I've been searching for them for so long and I didn't want to hype up the slider only to be disappointed. I wasn't. Flavorful and all gone in 4 bites (2 for the BF). Enough flavor on its own. You can also politely ask for some sauce (meant for dipping chicken tenders but oh well). I used ranch, BBQ and zesty zing on some of the sliders. Even though we ordered and took it to go, and made the 15 minute trek back to our hotel room to enjoy, the burgers were slightly damp, but still good! 

How successful were we in finishing the entire order? Maybe 70% of the way through. We dusted off all the fries and had only some sliders left. The remaining 30% was an excellent breakfast/lunch (not brunch since it was a weekday) meal!"
9xmf03pvDo4yPcbpvFnVbQ,"Except for the Curiosity factor this place was not satisfying. I have been to white castle in the past on the east coast they are quick, very inexpensive, and good for a snack. Worth it if you are looking for quantity rather than quality. However this place has none of that!!! Service was slow, Burgers were 3 to 4 times the price of the east coast, the place was a mess, No ice in machine, and the quality was much worse. I guess we should be lucky that we have the only white castle on the west coast but they really need to lower the prices increase the quality and get some Big Red in the soda machines."
3gwXw32xnkOr5uDmH4_TUQ,"We walked into Casino Royale and smelt something that made us both say ""Damn!"". My husband asked the security guard where that smell was coming from and he pointed us to White Castle, while he laughed. I thought that he was laughing at our hungry noses but soon after realized that he knew we were going to get diarrhea from this horrible shit. The amazing smell was the onions caramelizing on the grill. The little cheeseburgers were soggy and full of unwanted flavor. I am not a picky eater & I do not recommend."
PyvyzKxG3ZsqyGruhcAtAA,"My experience at White Castle was terrible, Tammy was the worse White Castle employee I have encountered in over 20 yrs. She was mean, rude, and her customers service is the worse EVER!!! Im really considering calling you guys corporate office. But the food was great im a fan forever. Tammy needs more training guys no way she should be a manager or supervisor thx 4 listening guys. Ps the onion are fried to much"
87cJpE7LsgPh4MrVWKfrkQ,Made my first visit to a White Castle ever and found myself at the one on the strip. Ive had the microwave hamburgers and wanted to see if it would be any different. It was just OK. Nothing to write home about. The cheeseburger seemed really soggy and the fries were cold. It was good to try but i will try other places on the strip.
Ua9AFuT29iyKJu9Cg9Cnbg,"OVERRATED. Wanted to try this place when they first opened but heard it was always busy. I thought, ""wow, it must be really good."" I relied on regular tv news and drunk friends instead of reviewing  yelp comments to help me decide if I was going to eat there and I paid the price. The taste of the meat was bland and the bread was like store bought buns. Really did not taste anything to make it stand out. I kept thinking I should have just gone to the store and bought the kings Hawaiian Sweet Bread and some burger meat and made my own.  I did like the loaded fries. They were tasty but the serving size was small.
Bright spot, i like how security tried to keep the line moving and safe."
23jcX0NFwWNAK1PZlb9dGQ,"Well I been hearing that white Castle is the best and it's like in n out.... this had to be one of the worst burgers I've ever had ...
I took 2 bites and to the trash it went the fries where pretty good"
cJrSR22mgT-h1uUCAh3okQ,"We loved the very thin patties and super soft bread.  Definitely not for those who like a meaty patty.  Clean for being so busy.  Great place for a fast food snack.  I didn't like the ranch dressing, but I'm pretty particular about that."
y5WoBVe6PN8_vR9a9s731g,"I had a terrible experience. It started off with me enjoying the fact that I'm in Vegas and seen a White Castle. I'm from Minnesota so to see a White Castle on the West Coast was like was Christmas in July. Finally found a parking spot this is really hard to there is no parking for them White Castle that is. Made it in and see no line, no surprise because White Castle always has a line. To my surprise a young man that was in line at the front front got upset because the people that were working we're laughing and doing nothing instead of working he being frustrated hit his cup off the counter counter. That's what got my attention he started screaming that there's a line of people and the people working are laughing joking not doing anything I noticed this was true they were all in a circle just kind of hanging burgers are sitting on the waiting table ready to be made or should I just say put together cuz they're already made and we're waiting. Fred the manager who was a woman I say that because I think they gave me the wrong name of the young lady but if Fred's the name Fred's the name Fred got mad at the young man for noticing that her workers weren't working and instead of apologizing threatened to give the money back, at first he was reluctant just wanted some ketchup but when that was a chore he said yes give me my money back. I just want to say that this made everyone get hands on deck when I say everyone's hands were moving they were all moving and I don't know if it was because Fred came out or if it was because the young man made a fuss but what I know is that I got my food a little bit quicker than I would have had he had not said anything... and he didn't even get to eat. Very sad to save my hometown restaurant Kansas City Missouri where my family is from, we grew up on White Castles. Bunch of onions piled up in the corner little mustard a pickle man that bread something else. I tell a lot of people about White Castles and everybody says this or says that me I love him Frozen from Minnesota or Frozen from in the grocery store what I don't like is bad customer service and that's exactly what I got at this White Castle with Fred as the manager. It was so bad that the drinks didn't even work and the young man who only was able to get his drink had to be mad about that as well."
6JBKAoXEjZN3-krGXkfItQ,"Food is great this is the new burger spot for a while, good location and service it was busy at first but now it's pretty mellow"
Lz8IJ3sDbFH8Dx8blWCHHg,It's not good at all. You go just for the experience of having White Castle because its not local to the west coast. The experience was cool but the food is meh. I hate In-N-Out but it's superior to White Castle.
YRkwYZB6vfmUusc_vPu9zQ,"Terrible burgers and fries. They taste worse than the microwavable ones. Their meat patties are disgusting, flavorless, and greasy. Not much to say because they don't offer much on their menu. Do not waste your money here."
Y4nfyvly6d_U8vPYyj8saA,"Okay, so Harold and Kumar are idiots? I don't get it? Little soggy sliders with mystery meat, a pickle and onions.... Maybe this is a midwest thing. But I just don't see the attraction. Very crowded so consider me one of the people who came to say they were there, but the food is plain and tasteless in my opinion. We ordered the combo #1 and split four sliders an order of fries and a 16 ounce soda. Total cost $8.64 and a waste of 30 minutes we can never get back... Skip this place, swing by any McDonald's in America and call it good! And by the way.... The movie wasn't good either...."
63-mxU389iUCGd63PI-oMQ,"Where do I start Tami? Manager on duty August 7, 2016 at 2:25 pm. HAIR IN MY SLIDER?! Yummy!!! Unreal. The service by TAMI, ummmm... Training? Perhaps?! Didn't know hair was offered as a side to my burger! Thanks for making my poor daughter dig out the rest of the order from the trash to prove we weren't looking for a FREEBIE. NEVER AGAIN!!!! If they had a rating for NEGATIVE STARS, I'd be able to rate WHITE CASTLE!!! AKA ""HAIR CASTLE""!"
ppxetbHXhPvFgGHdZWSwzw,"At $1.29 per slider, a totally underwhelming bite. All i tasted was a mouthful of mince meat and onions. I've tried the frozen white castle burgers back in college, and I think those were more memorable. Skip this place, and save your belly for tastier Vegas eats."
RRTDEZuXzATKpgjIfGormQ,"So happy they chose Las Vegas out of all the cities here in the West ! The burgers tasted just as I remembered when I was a kid back in the day ! The line tonight was not nearly as long as yesterday , and I was in within about 30 min or so ! I love yet another choice of burgers in town ... and for us that grew up with them it is a welcome sight ! Glad you are here White Castle and hope you can open more locations in town !"
d6xXENk0zCpLVVrvJJSpOg,"White Castle goes one of two ways typically.  People are either fanatics or hate it.  Personally, I fall in the former category.  Their fries are delicious, the sliders are unique, offering a steamed variation on the burger.  And the toppings are minimal yet effective.  For the first time, I got a chicken ring sliders which was pretty good and seemed to offer a sizable piece of chicken.  In N' Out may be a little better, but White Castle is great as well.  Having the closest location to Los Angeles, I stopped at the Vegas White Castle for a Crave Case.  I went for the Cheeseburger Sliders, which run about $41 for a case of 30.  Although I remember them having ketchup, when I asked for them to hold the ketchup, I was informed they came without ketchup, but did have pickles which I did not remember.  These ones were not quite as steamed or good as some of the east coast locations, but hey, I'm eating White Castle so who am I to complain?!  I'm not sure that the pickles were needed and as they sit in my freezer while I work my way through the case, I may regret getting a smaller order and going for the frozen ones at home, but so far I have yet to be too disappointed.  And if anything the mental appeal and novelty of having an authentic White Castle experience awaiting in my freezer will help give it an edge."
oMfmo6cT-idLGi8fnM-nEA,"Relatives from Chicago were right - definitely nothing special. 
Recommend everyone try it once to satisfy your curiosity, but the burgers are terribly bland, flavorless, limp, and unexciting. 

Drunk friends were not fans as well"
DmIbq0-PDMHpZF8tdNK_VQ,"I have been waiting over 25 years to try a White Castle burger from a restaurant. I don't know if the Las Vegas location does the brand justice, and I might be talking crazy here, but I actually prefer the microwave burgers from the grocery store. 

The burgers at this restuarant are much greasier, inconsistent (one of my burgers came with pickles, the other did not), and somehow lacked flavor compared to its microwave counterpart. I also tried the chicken rings-just your average chicken nugget. I don't know if it is just a western state thing, but they did offer jalapeno cheese which was a plus. For the size of the burgers, they are certainly overpriced-but I guess that's nothing new.

Because it's Vegas, they have beer on tap, but it is of the cheap variety. But then again, it is fast food after all. I will eventually give this brand another chance in the mid-west."
BXIu3M4YcZ_Bg1DJfOrcDA,"Tried White Castle for the first time at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest and thought they were decent. I think there was more hype about how great they were that made me want to give it a try. 

When I heard about White Castle opening in Vegas I thought I should try it from the real place instead of a food truck. So I went with a friend opening day. The line wrapped around the building. We waited for about an hour and a half but moved pretty fast considering the line of people. While waiting it was nice to see some of the staff coming out to talk to us and we're so enthusiastic about opening. 

When we finally got to the front I had to try one of everything. Almost everything. We got the original sliders , fries, loaded fries and chicken rings. Once we had the food to ourselves we indulged. Loved the chicken rings and who doesn't love fries. The loaded fries tasted good but I could have done without the bacon,sadly it didn't taste like good crispy bacon we all love. Annnnnd then the sliders...they tasted just as I remembered from the foodie fest. Luke warm and wet, almost soggy bread. 
I'm an optimist so I do wanna go back and try it again and hope it was only like that due to the craziness of opening day. If not, definitely munchie or drunk food. 

P.S. Get a beer! The way they serve it is pretty awesome."
JSp0rnAl371Pg-MyfpEsPA,Had to come here after watching Harold & Kumar and was so excited they opened one up in the west coast. Came here before heading home from Vegas and I thought it was perfect for a hangover. It is fast food so don't expect anything fancy or high quality ingredients. Just greasy goodness on the go!
gqVqMV6wS_ffSI7O_Nyj5g,"So yeah.  White Castle.  Uhm it's a thing here now.  Honestly it has been a thing here for about a decade.  I say this because it tastes exactly the same as the frozen microwave burgers.  Exactly? Well not really because there is a pickle in these ones.  

The location is on the strip in the small casino north of the Venetian by the Linq parking lot. It's very fast paced and as soon as we ordered we weren't able to fill up our drinks halfway before our order of 20 cheese sliders, 9 piece chicken rings, onion chips and fries were done.  

To say the least it was not the most rewarding way for me to break my pescetarian seafood diet.  At best it could be said that you could enjoy the satisfaction that us West coasters can now join the likes of dining in an East coast fast food institution.  Not as rewarding as the opposite experience is for East coasters trying a Double Double & Animal Style Fries from In & Out for the first time.  

We got hugely full sharing a 10 pack of sliders for 2 and the baby loved the chicken rings though.  We brought the second 10 pack home for my little bro.  Sadly he had to microwave them slightly by then.  Completely rehashing the same old feeling of eating them the frozen way.  He noted that it was cheaper and more convenient to have just got them at the freezer section.  They may even use the exact ingredients at the restaurant?

It was fun.  Everyone should try it at least once.  I may rather stick to a grilled cheese w/ grilled onions with Animal Style fries & a 7up next time without the strip traffic though."
lLkVJ6nUdKxlywAW7FD1YQ,"First timer here... If it's good enough for Harold and Kumar to make a movie out of it, so had to try it. So basically the burgers are like sliders on Hawaiian type bread. Drunk and stoner food all the way dude! I liked the burgers, they come 4 in a combo pack. Why is there not one in So. Cal? Go figure... This area of the strip is kind of sketchy, although close to the High Roller."
75Pc7L1vThtoYCLbKm2bDA,"Mediocre place, tastes like something out of the freezer, microwaved to serve. This is definitely a hype. Oh, and Be careful eating here, as me and my bf spent days being sick on the toilet. Seems like we weren't the only ones."
USOKx8i4GgbFrLyru2P1JA,"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     47/100

I had no idea these palm size burgers existed till I watched Harold and Kumar in the theater, 10+ years ago! Because of that movie (one of my fave movies btw), I have also been a fan of White Castle before trying those bite size burgers. 

Luckily, before they opened up shop in Vegas, I had to settle for the frozen squares at the local market. 

Now that we are lucky to have our own White Castle, I finally got to try them! 

I was not disappointed. I knew what to expect and I can say that they taste a little better than the frozen - microwave version I tried before. Still a fan. 

It's convenient if you're walking the Strip. Once you pass this, you're gonna wanna pop in and grab a couple to continue your walk.  

There are toppings available. Try them if you haven't before. Prices are reasonable. Keep in mind, it's on the Strip. 

The only thing missing was a photo booth with Harold and Kumar! haha John Cho..... :-)"
5BkOQ7X1YPUeybR65FeBbA,"I feel compelled to review this White Castle mainly because of the stream of slightly negative reviews.  First things first, White Castle does not serve a killer gourmet 16 ingredient big burger.  They're small simple classic sliders from the oldest American fast food chain.  People who have had them both crave it and are nostalgic for it.  Bottom line is to appreciate for what it is.  Simple.

We went here on a Harold and Kumar esk trek from Downtown LV.  The location is convenient to guests of the Casino Royale or any strip hotel connected to it.  Way less convenient for all others.  We parked in Harrah's which is fairly close and you can walk to the joint inside the casino as Harrah's and Casino Royale are connected.  Parking is free and the walk is less than 5 mins. 

I've heard a lot about the insane lines so we opted to go when all others are asleep at 5am.  Yes, burgers for breakfast!!  Walked up and ordered in less than 2 minutes and food served 5 minutes after that.  Employees were friendly and obviously over whelmed by the onslaught of customer pouring in all day.  I was impressed they were so positive and that's certainly not been my experience in White Castles past.  The crew were bantering with each other making for a positive vibe which was nice especially if you've getting beat down by the casinos.

I'd say enjoy the multitude of employees that are working in anticipation of the crowds because when it's slow its still fresh and super fast.

There's a couple of workers constantly cleaning so the place is well kept and clean.  Another nice change based on my past experiences with this chain else where.

The set up can make the view from the strip looking in deceiving.  While it may look like there's a large crowd it could just be people eating their food and standing around.  The dining area is toward the strip and the ordering area is inward.  I'd say a good rule is if you see a line extending out doors then ok it's a long line.  Else you should check inside cause the line may not be that long.

We had the 20 originals with 2 fries combo for $28.  Just over a buck each which is standard.  They could gouge us but I'm glad to see they didn't.  

We have eaten these many times so having these without being in the mid west is a treat indeed.   These little suckers and simple and tasty.  Soft bun, slim patty, grilled onions and a garlic-esk seasoning makes em tasty.  They pretty much melt in your mouth which I love.  Swallow em whole I say (I can't btw)!  Average person can probably eat about 3-5.  We had 10 each.  Don't Judge!!!  We weren't drunk or stoned.

Fries are crinkle cut and crispy.  Add some salt.  Get one order fries for every 5 sliders.

Bottom line is that it's a White Castle for those who have had em.  The same except this one is very modern and much cleaner than those I've been.  For Noobs, don't buy into the hype.  Keep in mind, where these are from, they are very convenient, never crowded, and relatively cheap.  Don't expect a miracle in a burger and you'll find they are great by their own right.  These things have character like that cool friend everyone knows but nobody sees.  

Looking forward to having more next time I'm in town.  Congrats Vegas!  Lucky you."
AddnrBOTm0LVoOyG09YAAA,"Got lucky and didn't wait long on a Saturday afternoon. 
First time but not impressed at all. 
Tastes like a McDonald's cheeseburger but a little tastier but with a higher price tag. 
Definitely not worth the trip."
fjq3GqGlerWpoMCJ843nAQ,For my first time I actually liked it!! Maybe only because I'm a burger person. If you enjoy just a simple type of burger this is the place
csJXbU4pB5Xjzq14JLj9sQ,"I'm really disappointed with this White Castle location.  The prices here are about 20+% marked up from a normal White Castle store, and the menu is also VERY limited. Pretty much regular burger, cheese burger and chicken rings, thats it! The lines can get really long here, but it does move pretty quickly, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Ultimately, the product is lacking. Don't let this be your first/only impression of White Castle, the east coast locations are great!"
1hTDNnZLtPOnPMj2emRrFw,"From 7/24/15 
We came here after a concert, and let me just say this White Castle is not like the ones I am used to in NY. Now, taking in account this location is on The Strip, I had to remind myself not to pick it apart for being overcrowded after all there are tons of hungry tourist to feed.

Once you get your burgers, it's typical White Castle- cheap and delicious. I just hope they make one off The Strip for those of us who just want their burger goodness minus all the tourist."
VVHW4O26PbHfQoobmBVRFg,"After hearing about White Castle since Harold and Kumar made it a thing, I was happy to learn there was one within reach in Vegas. After deciding to plan a mini-vacation to Vegas, my boyfriend's only request was to come here, so we did. Maybe this is one of those 'this is so good' when you're drunk type of places, because we just thought- meh. A solid ""it's okay""-3 stars but nothing to text home about."
SOZKnmyRYA0O9VqbpO9hrw,"Tucked in the heart of Las Vegas Boulevard at the Casino Royale is a White Castle. Although prices were a little higher than other White Castles, it was a welcome price break from the more spendy food options on the Strip.

The lines were long, but what other White Castle can you also buy beer? 

Enjoy the signature steamed square burger sliders, strongly flavored with chopped white onion. We particularly liked the fish slider which I thought was a cut above McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. The crinkle fries were okay. 'Try the crunchy onion bits. Although it isn't fancy, White Castle sliders hit the spot when you need a bite when you are on a tight budget."
oKoS1oYu3kDiZWs8PLvGYg,"I was so excited to come here when I found out it finally came that much closer to California. I've been wanting to come here since I saw the movie. Prior I had only had White Castle from the frozen section but frozen can never measure up to the freshly prepared sliders. So on my first night out in Vegas for my company's annual trip and after a jillion glasses of Rieslings later, my boss (who is from Detroit) took me and my co workers here. We walked all the way from New York New York! Since it was my first time going to a White Castle restaurant I kept it simple and ordered six sliders and fries. The sliders were even better than the packaged ones! I think is the the fresh onions that give the sliders that bang. However I would say the fries were nasty because they were hard and cold. I complained about it all night. There was no wait because we received our food pretty fast. Hey a drunk can't tell no tales. Lol

Hopefully when I come back I will be in a more sober state of mind."
-jMKvsr0lUlYOsb1y9IRZA,It's White Castle....not my favorite but not bad when you're hungry. Overpriced steamed mini burgers that's all. The bread is always moist and soggy and the meat is just weird. The wait was over 20 minutes but hey it's on Las Vegas Blvd so I'm not expecting it to be quick. I'm not sure what the hype is but I'm not impressed.
PS_yqp2oWYYNXSYVt0p6mw,"Growing up in the West, I've never really gotten to experience White Castle fresh. I've only experienced the frozen kind that you buy at your local markets. With that said, and with rave reviews of friends and family, my experience here was anti climatic. I'll have to admit that the fresh ones were slightly better than the frozen one you make at home. These famous sliders are steamed on a bed of grilled onions with a very thin slice of hamburger,  (And I mean thin. I suppose so that it could cook faster) and topped with a bun to also steam. If you want cheese, that is extra. Your slider also contains a pickle. If you want double meat that would be extra as well. I had order the cheese slider combo. It came with 4 sliders, fries or onion chips, and a drink. This cost about $9. Prices are a bit high for what you are receiving. That is to be expected considering it is on the Las Vegas Strip. It's always busy and within one of the casino in Vegas."
skbSkn6hntVDnSz5wFW9bw,"Never have been to this establishment ever before, I decided to give in and see what all of this hype about White Castle is all about .....  I honestly don't understand it ... You do get your order very quick and it's not expensive.... But they are just soo tiny! They taste okay, nothing that screams out go there again ....."
XGPpQ0nycIPPvIj02UNKNA,"We literally had nothing better to do, so why the hell not. Got in line a little after 3pm on opening day. The line was long but very orderly, and moved consistently. Not as bad as Disneyland. The employees and volunteers were awesome. Everyone had a great attitude. It took about 40 mins to get to the front of the line, then once inside there was another small line of about 20 people deep.

Right before we got inside, they started giving out free regular sliders as samples. I seriously thought about getting out of line after the sample. The beef is literally 1/8"" thick. It's $1.09 for a plain slider, $1.50 for one with cheese. You would have to layer probably three patties to get it the same thickness of say a $1 burger at McD's.  Imagine if you ordered a $1 burger at a fast food place and got a White Castle style slider. You'd be pissed right? But people are lining up for these and buying them by the box! You can add on extra pickles or onions for no charge, otherwise there is only one pickle. No sauce either, but you can ask for ketchup, mayo, etc.

They have $5 shakes too, but no bourbon in them. They didn't even fill it to the top!

C13bNx4aqLlWpUbqEQ5-RQ,"Disappointing. White Castle was pretty hyped up for me thanks to my friends. As I was walking the strip looking for a place to eat, I stumbled across it and decided I might as well try it. I ordered a variety of things: onion rings, chicken nugget like things and two sliders.

Onion rings, unfortunately these were the highlight of my meal....they were the best tasting thing I ordered and even then they were just okay.

The chicken nuggets tasted very stale and were pretty small too. For reference I am a fan of McD's nuggets.

The sliders were bad. They tasted like meat paste covered in onion inside a bun. I cringed while eating them and so did the friend I was with.

At least their service is nice though?"
9i5BzXaCVxSAfXnLnD-TJQ,DONT FORGET TO ASK FOR CHEESE!!!! Besides that so much better then frozen if your from Chicago New York New Jersey or anyone of the states facings he Atlantic Ocean this should really bring back memories
N7yA8Av5rECXp3cSpV-cBw,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - 2/100

My friends and I wanted to kill some time before heading back to the hotel and getting ready for another night of clubbing, so we decided on stopping by White Castle for a food adventure. 

All I can say is the burger is mediocre, the soda is flat, and even the fries are underwhelming. If I were to name one thing that I could potentially eat... it would be the chicken rings. Still tasted a little plastic-y though."
kIbchaE8rQszRasMgjuckg,"Do not expect the cheap prices you have back home, but do expect a classic White Castle experience on the Las Vegas Strip. The western most outpost of the east coast chain is at the Casino Royale between Harrah's and the Venetian.

Veterans know what to expect. White Castle specializes in small burgers called sliders with a thin beef patty grilled in onions. You order several paired with fries or chicken rings, although I always recommend doubling down on the sliders as the fries are rather basic.

The real value comes from the large packs of sliders. You can get a bag or case of them to take back to the room for a cheap price. The restaurant is nice to eat in with basic decorations and easy access.

It's nice to see some east coast classics make their way to Las Vegas. White Castle is not the best burger on the strip, but it's comforting to have them as a fun option while visiting."
TzYGRxoLKOIOoNkgUUUDVQ,"I decided to go to Vegas with my friend one weekend and since i was here I decided to bring some white castle home for the family. 

I was staying at the palazzo so I decided to wake up extra early at 7am on a Sunday to stand in line to get some mini burgers. I arrived and was so excited that there was no line. Not even one person in front of me. I decided to order the crave case. It came with 30 sliders for $34.99. The workers are really fast at what they are doing and got me my case of sliders super fast. 

I took a bite and was really disappointed. It didn't have much flavors and the ones I have made at home were so much better than from the actually white castle. 

Overall, I will not be back. Not worth it. Try it and now I will try to forget about it."
h_RWQONgp5uad0X4cQuNpw,"It's not gourmet food, but it IS a White Castle out here in the southwestern US!  For pure nostalgia and novelty it gets at least 3 stars.  The food is just how I remember it last time I had it driving through New Jersey.  I got the yummy crinkle fries and those cheese sliders kissed with onion steam.  Mmmm.  The line went pretty quickly, and the cashier was friendly.  Love the castle facade on the Strip!  It's connected to the Best Western/Casino Royale's food court, which let's face it, is not the most stellar hotel/casino out here.  I did go out of my way just for this food, but it was worth it to me.  Again, just the fact that it's out here is worth a lot.  Now I only have to drive 5 hours, not fly across the country, if I ever get another craving.  :)"
DRyF25xToznKWQZVJNCMdA,"I see a lot of bad ratings about this place and while I can see how some people might feel, I think they got it all wrong. I mean you can't compare it to anything else which some do talking about how you can get bigger better burgers. You don't come here for a double double, you don't come here for a 1/2 lb patty. These are White Castle sliders. This is what you come here for. These mini perfect two bite sliders steamed on a bed of onions. 
The next complaint I hear is about the price being more expensive then back east. This is the Las Vegas strip. It's not cheap to be here. Let them make their money. It's not insane. Meals are about $8-$10. A damn McDonald's meal can come out to almost $7 or $8 off the strip, give them a break! In fact it's the same price or maybe even a little cheaper than when it comes to the foodie festival and no one complains about that. And this is a legit White Castle. Not a truck just serving the sliders. 
The sliders are the real deal. The sides are good, small, but good. The service is impeccable. Even with long lines you get your food in 5-10 minutes. I got mines in 3. It's kept as clean as possible considering the crowd that comes through here. 
The bottom line is this is secured in my places to eat at and I'm more than thankful to have it so close to me. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the casino it's in, and the type of crowd that comes from that casino. You'll see what I mean. To get an idea, as I write this review, there have been literally thousands of people who have gone here and only 55 yelp reviews. So they're not exactly the courteous foodie type. 
But it's White Castle, and it's here, the farthest west it's ever been. Try it. Love it. Carry on."
7Mpha2oC77j5VvdT9B7gpw,"Not sure if lackluster taste or just sober.

I've gone to White Castle locations in the East Coast a few years back and remember tasting the sweetness of caramelized onions with that salty square patty and having a huge smile on my face from the first slider to the last. This time around... not so much.

Granted it is a fast food chain and not much should be expected but nonetheless I'm voicing a little disappointment. I'm sure after knocking a few back through the night this place would have been a godsend but not when I'm sober and chauffeuring people from out of town trying to explain that this chain had a whole movie revolving around it. 

The sliders do come somewhat neatly packed into their signature boxes and it's always a fun time when you take 20 of them to make a nice castle to DESTROY. We opted for half regular and half with cheese for this order. 

Fries were under-seasoned and kind of took me back to the days of my childhood eating cafeteria food... you know what... let's just call this experience that.

Having White Castle on the Las Vegas strip in the early evening is like over-paying for the same $2.50 slider and fry combo you would buy at your school cafeteria during lunch. I wouldn't say it's terrible but it's not that great either. In our case, we went for the number 9* pack for 4 people and still left a bit hungry and our international friends very disappointed (sorry folks).

*Drinks and cheese are extra"
9tZBZWr-jt7ti0P8BIrgRg,"No where like the ones in NYC.  No fish sandwich or clam strips. Chocolate shake was almost 6 bucks too.  Which brings me to the fact that the sliders in Vegas are about 45 cents more than the east coast which doesn't surprise me. Food out here in the desert costs more in grocery stores and most fast food chains.  Quality and taste? Well, the slider was on the dry side and the onions didn't exist. I'm not a fan of them anyhow and only stop in to see if the fish and clams are available yet.  Having no other choice, I pick up a few sliders.  Far from the worse place I've ever been, but anyone who's been to the ones in NYC will know the difference.  The "" good ole boys"" here in Vegas think it's a great place to eat and talk all day about "" no state income tax"" here. But that 900 a year to register there truck is fine and dandy along with all the other super inflated city and state fees.  Point is .....ignorance is bliss.  If you don't know what a real White Castle is, you'll be happy.  Every real NY'er I know thinks this Vegas location sucks. Will I be back? Not for a slider. Hopefully the fish and clams will be here.  Then again, they'll probably fuck those up too and charge 40% more for them since we're sitting in this "" rock quarry"" called Las Vegas."
V9CLSYm63fvrfBpGFHpsTg,"We came here for a midnight snack post Blueman show. 

This place was busy!  Waited in line for 5 minutes and decided to order combo #2- 4 White Castle cheeseburgers, fries, and a drink. 

The very friendly attendant recommended the onion chips instead of their regular crinkle cut fries. Great recommendation!  It's like onion rings but in wedge form. Burgers were nothing spectacular; steamed mini buns with grilled onions, processed cheese, a pickle, and a ham-like slice of hamburger. This place is overrated but makes a good and inexpensive snack (individual burgers are $1.29). Do keep in mind that each burger is the size of a dinner bun."
y4O4IfJ4DDDP_LePhYX2xg,I was pretty excited to try White Castle and I was a little shocked to see Vegas had a location. I had no idea what to expect as I only knew of White Castle through H&K so I went in with an open mind. The line to the register wasn't horribly long and it gave me enough time to look up at the menu. Since I only wanted to try the burgers I just went for a very small meal option that consisted of a burger and fries.
tlbeWVtRfFnKsXJAhWuIWg,I was so disappointed in this place. We had the sliders for a late night snack. They were not tasty. The onion rings were better than the fries.
IVhW8LcTLk1nPaanEkBFeQ,"We're from San Diego, so my boyfriend was eager to eat White Castle that wasn't out of a food truck----it tasted the same lol. I wasn't impressed because a burger can only go so far with flavor, especially White Castle's concept with simple sliders with just meat, buns, optional cheese, onions and pickles. But they're still good and easy to eat. They're also fun to eat. Their food is a cute portion, which allows you to order more of them, or just sticking to a nice small portion that we should be eating haha. 

Taste-wise: their burgers honestly taste like McDonald's dollar cheeseburgers to me, BUT BETTER. I stress the better because i'm comparing them to McDonald's. White Castle has better buns, better meat, and better sides for sure. Their onion chips are my faaaaavorite. The chicken rings are okay, dry if anything but a good change if you want chicken as your side. And their french fries remind me of cafeteria fries, and i like cafeteria food. 

White Castle is cheap, which is a plus. They aren't trying to sell gourmet food so don't expect gourmet burgers. They're just simple, small, and not bad at all. I can see White Castle doing very well in SoCal and be highly competitive with all of SoCal's other burger joints, seriously. It would be a nice addition to fast food joints i can choose from. 

I'm just deducting one star because their food isn't anything out of the ordinary (what do you expect with fast food though?)--but i'm sure that wasn't their goal to begin with, sober at least."
mLfIbFg8Xk5D5p4fwSO2VA,"Very over priced for such a small amount of food.

No cheese sticks.

Rip off.  Go elsewhere.  Not good."
il8n3Lg4TVVZ81SkJxwH0A,"I was hoping it would be White Castle, with all the things that encompasses - the burgers, the smells, the fun, the other food items, etc.   I waited till the lines were reasonable and they could get in their groove.

Well their groove wasn't so groovy.  One of the best things about their slider is how the bun melts a little into the hot burger.  For whatever reason they weren't nearly as hot as they should be.  Lost the flavor and the smell. 

A $5+ dollar shake, each burger was 50 cents over regular WC's and not as good, it wasn't a place were you were eating fun for a few bucks anymore.

I'll wait till I'm back in NY for my next one.  Didn't want to be disappointed but . . .

If you're familiar with White Castle and love them, you won't want to get familiar with this one.   Keep the memory of how they were."
YP4xxQ3qLSstGtVtujr3Hg,"Sunday May 28th 2017 at 10:54 PM. 

*This my first time ever going to write castle.*

The line was about about a 20 minute wait which was really low wait.  This place can be really packed at times.  Try going later or really early if you don't want a line wrapped around the building outside.

There's very little sitting and just be really friendly with other diners.  We sat near a gentleman from LA in town for a concert. We chatted before his food came out. He bought one of everything on the menu which I realized was accurately smart. He ate his food and didn't even touch his bacon cheese fries, he was so full he gave us the bacon cheese fries.

We were so full after we left and it pays to be friendly with neighboring people.  We had a number #7  ten sliders pack, cheese was a $3 up charge.  I think I had 5 little cheese sliders they had pickles and onions.  It was a surprise they have a 10% locals discount!!!

Now serving breakfast MIDNIGHT until 11 AM!!!"
5IL76eMhzKm8WnFxpgbFRg,This might sound silly to some but I have never had White Castle and always wanted to but somehow on all my trips across the country I always missed going to one. Finally made it to one in Las Vegas and for a late night snack it was good. Simple yet good. Nothing else really tastes like it. Just do it if in Vegas from CA its the nearest one to us on the west coast I guess.
vyyvb3PLtd8lVHjvfZLycQ,"hecky no, &12.00 for 10 burgers.  no way, however on a wed. nite easy available parking in the rear....and why do they need 3 burly security guards standing around staring at you, is somebody gonna get shot? No W.C. I am not paying your damn rent, ..rippoff, they are 45cents each back east, . Purchased 2 full sacks got home and it was cruddy old meat that they had under lights or had just reheated, crusty on the edges and old.     DONT SELL ME-your old GARBAGE PLEASE... very dissapointed.  buy the one in the store, youre better off."
rIymj3e5CgP4oEWpJJ9Uhw,"Could you have put this in a worst location for locals. Hard to get to, middle of the strip. Virtually no parking. 


Build more OFF THE STRIP."
G_k9GEdAX8doPPbBR5Xxlw,"Hmm.  As a native Chicagoan, I was STOKED to find out there was a White Castle in Vegas when I planned our last trip.  This one wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't wasn't the same as the ones back home.  They were tasty, and not bad at all, but they just tasted like the boxed ones that you can pick up at Vons, only with someone else heating them up for you.  I'd come back while drunk or on a craving, but for an authentic White Castle burger it looks like I'll be catching a flight from LAX back to O'Hare."
6F_E-VUEf-XMk13eyPB94g,"Little burgers, in a square box
Little burgers, made with beef, onions and a pickle
Little burgers, in a square box
Little burgers all the same.

Because of the novelty expect to pay at least $9.00; a meal that includes four sliders, fries and drink."
Az1wtxvfv8JQAjPOnKl-ww,"Growing up in Texas, we have always had the frozen White Castle burgers in grocery stores but never the actual castles. For some reason, the frozen white castle burgers have always been incredibly delicious to me. Disclaimer: I am no burger aficionado. I'm a simple girl, I can have a meal consist of frozen foods and be happy. I've always wanted to go to the actual White Castle after obviously being inspired by Harold and Kumar and I'm glad there's a location in Vegas for me to finally check out. The burgers taste exactly the same as the freezer burgers except the ""fresh"" ones have pickles. I can rest easy now that I can continue buying the freezer burgers back home and know that it does not taste any different from those at the actual White Castle. The onion chips are addicting as well. I would opt for those over the crinkle-cut fries."
2TFSK74rAsgPMO2vqVGVkA,"I wasn't impressed with White Castle's food. The slides had more bread than meat, no flavor, and the fries were something you could buy from the local grocery store. I was impressed with how fast they moved us through the long line and how they served the beer."
yw4JgqA-QWoBc6MCp0EvGw,"It's a 2...because we didn't spit it out LOL. That's a good start, right? Makes your mouth water? It also gets a 2 instead of a 1 because it was very organized. The line looked really long, but we were only in line for about 10-15 minutes and then it took maybe another 5 to get the actual food.

So here's the deal. My husband and I have lived in So-Cal all our lives, so even though we've always heard of White Castle---the East Coast version of In n Out, we had never gotten to try it. We were SUPER excited when we randomly saw they had one in Vegas that we had to stop and try it! Yay!

We had seen the frozen ones at Ralphs for years, but didn't ever want to ruin our first experience for when we did eventually get to try the real thing....in hindsight I feel like the frozen ones might actually be better!

We weren't very hungry so we just ordered 2 cheese sliders and 1 double cheese slider with no onions for me. PROTIP: Yes you can order individually even though they aren't on the menu that way.

We were lucky enough to instantly find a table (it was packed), sat down, and dug in. Upon first bite we both looked at each other with a WTF look on our faces. We had waited years to try this? Avoided the frozen version? Waited in line. Ew.

The buns were soggy and wet, the meat was gray. Not a good combination. Like I said we didn't spit them out, so I guess it gets a 2 star, but OMG they were pretty close to terrible. 

This is what all the hype is about? I admit I think they're cute in those little boxes, but the compliments pretty much end there. 

I think I figured it out though...you must have to be high riding on white tigers like Harold and Kumar to be able to say you enjoyed those things.

Thanks but no thanks White Castle...ew.

In N Out for the win....West Coast 4eva!"
GOkSCxLu2yQGRQ19wT4OFQ,Taste just like old times to me. Prices are different because it's on the strip. But nice friendly service
zaF7zs9aXRR6a9VXB0AT8Q,"Not sure what all the HYPE about White Castle is all about. You can get a way better burger for cheaper at Shack Shake, Steak N Shake, Fatburger, or even McDonalds, if you want a late night meal, Del Taco is better than White Castle. I think people rate it in the nostalgia feeling and the memories, because it's totally not worth it. 
The line did move fast and it was clean, but based on taste, no way. You're in Vegas, were you can get a gourmet burger for $6.99  (at Flemings Steakhouse)  or a decent burger at local bars for the same price."
JmpFEIdDMxLQp9LHd3mkFA,"2/26- So I reached out to WC that day regarding the mistake in my order and have yet to receive a response.  Apparently customer service isn't that important when you're selling thousands of hamburgers a day.

________

Being originally from Chicago, I've been dying to get here, but wanted to wait until the craziness died down.  I finally made it over for lunch at Noon.  Believe it or not, my wait was only about 5 minutes.  Yes, they were busy (and the line grew for lunchtime as I was there), but still not the hours it was when it opened. 

It's definitely more expensive than the typical WC, but understandable both being on the Strip & delivering the food from the Midwest.  With that said, the burgers & onion ri..., er, chips are how I remembered--fantastic.  The frozen ones in the stores don't even compare.

The workers were friendly & the place clean.  However they did forget my wife's chicken rings; and considering it's overpriced & I live 15 miles away, that's an issue.

Regardless, I know I'll return when I get the crave"
yxYZqD9GRYIn3WTnwRYqbQ,Food and speed of service gets a solid 5 stars. Manny the security guard gets a -5 stars resulting in a score of 1.  Manny should not work with customers.
RA-HJIqaM-A-ZAk9J638ow,It's exactly what I expected. It's worth 4 stars for not having to fly east for fresh sliders.  Price is a little higher than normal and I wish they had the jalapeno cheese burger. Still happy they're here.
4kJDC5VMC6LRK4XkNia1Sw,Best Sliders by far.  I'm not sure how some people can write a bad review on these burgers.  I'm from the Midwest and live in Vegas and these are just the same as back home.  I guess you have to have an home town love for these belly bombers to appreciate them.  I feel bad for all the haters out there that had high expectations after watching some dumb movie.  I will return again and again.
GsGacUdDS8KTw7ROkUzRkA,"I've heard of White Castle and I've seen them in the freezer section at my local supermarket. 

Now they've got one on the Strip.  The five of us dropped in for a snack following a show at the Venetian.  

Queued up and looked at overhanging menu posted above.  Combo pack = 10 burgers, two fountain drinks, and two orders of fries could satisfy our palates.

The order taker asked if we wanted cheese.  O.k.   Total came to about $24.00.

Almost $5.00 per person for a what we got didn't seem worth it to me.  I'll pass next time.  But those are the kind of prices even for junk food in Vegas.

Mystery burger meat shaped thin and square.  The chopped onions and the pickle made up for it.  Soft burger bun.  Maybe two to four bites depending on your bite.  Served in individual cardboard boxes.  I say save money and use paper.  Need to be more eco friendly.

The kitchen was working hard.  Look over the counter and you'll see the assembly line.

And another mentally challenged person who popped himself at our table.  Talking and mumbling to himself.  First in Phoenix and now in Vegas."
5YhAcxV7GukmkqmoPxPm-A,"So glad to have The Castle in Vegas. Other than the parking situation for us locals, it is on the money. Was a bit disappointed on my first visit(I think the employees were still learning), however all the rest were just right. This is not gourmet, it's fast food. I could eat those cheese sliders morning, noon, or night. Thank You White Castle!!!"
t8xM0FkcpKzmyioa8LsKWg,"Food was good not as I expected to be but it's ok . Cashier was nice but Shelly ""old lady"" super rude looked at me as if I was some kind of cereal killer or something . Can't believe it I've never felt so offended in my life getting fast food"
j_U8LCRJYej4HFE0t1YpTw,Great food of course! Place is Awesome! The staff is friendly. Will definitely make this a must visit whenever I come to Vegas. It is a new must go place for me and my family. We actually waited in line two different days.
PH5qnsQtek_1H4x-4X0mZA,I got caught up in the hype of wanting to try this out.  I've had a frozen white castle burger a long time ago.  It was alright.  Coming here today and consuming their food I've come to the conclusion this place is an acquired taste.  The cheese slider #2 combo with fries comes with grilled onions and a pickle inside the sliders.  If I had a choice between In n Out or Smashburgers I would choose those 2 over this.  I didn't think the food was at the level of quality of other burger joints I've eaten at.  I recommend trying this place out at least once and let your taste buds decide if its worthy.  Or to at least say you've eaten at a white castle.
NIRoaHq6ZI7ItwKeZMq5mA,"Boyfriend and I were sick for 2 days. My stomach was still not right after eating here and for 2 weeks I had issues. I am finally feeling better but wow, I will never crave this place ever again."
apKJh05tsgVREGo3A6f0mQ,"Not my cup of tea. Service was fast and friendly, but the burgers were gross maybe I'm just used to things like in n out.... This burger was terrible!"
-bNkRHKxWyfecWJoHd_W7g,Delicious! The burgers are amazing and super cute! So happy they have a location in Vegas now!!!! Definitely a must when you visit the Vegas Strip!!!
RSragJtjb_ZGNFNeuJFe1Q,"Okay so a White Castle in the east coast for 60 cents a slider would have a little more appeal. But at 1.20 a slider in the west coast? No appeal what so ever. Even a hamburger at nasty McDonald's would be cheaper and more flavorful. The sliders are literally the size of a half dollar coin, and takes less than a bite to eat. Like you read in the other reviews, the meat is paper thin, our sliders had barely any grilled onions in it, and the bread was soggy. It tasted like literally paper. If it was actually the same prices of the east coast white castles then I could see the appeal in getting filled by buying like a million sliders for cheap although you're wasting it on eating a pile of flavorless junk."
IdN-nVMIZsibkxW3ozDybw,"Nothing special except that the prices are way higher than the East coast White Castles! Well, duh Vegas!!! Ordered the #2 combo. It comes with 4 cheeseburger sliders , fries and a drink for $8.99. I really thought i was going to finish all that by myself, but i was wrong!! Definitely, come here if you want to what the big hype is. If you can't, Frozen version from the supermarket is not so much of a difference!"
YWm2T0q_lv9298wYNjTiEw,"White Castle, it finally exists in Las Vegas. No longer do you need to fly out to the east coast 4 hours away or eat microwavable frozen white castle from the grocery.  Harold and Kumar can finally get their fix in Sin City. While the location in Best Western Hotel is a little bit awkward, it's also quite convenient being that there is parking in the back. I came here in the morning before heading back out to Los Angeles. The staff was in full force and looked like they were ready for a big crowd to come through. I might have been one of the first people to walk in that day so my order was very quick considering that I ordered a crave case."
FKnTbqstbPjgKjAUQvytcg,"I think just like everybody else, I wanted to try this place after watching the movie Harold and Kumar. 11 years later, finally made it here. For some reason, could not locate it in New York, but found it in Vegas. Saw people taking pictures here. 

It's actually really good. Surpassed my expectations. Got the mini cheese sliders. It's really good. Fresh and lots of flavor. I love the onions baked into the meat. It's so much better than the ones sold frozen in the grocery aisle. 

The bad is the long line, long wait, and price. However, would definitely return."
ck_fuGHzOtg7J9z25Kb5EA,"It's always busy here, but to me, it's worth the wait. Every time we are in Vegas we make a stop for White Castle. This time I tried the onion chips and loved them. Burgers are always good. I wish they had one in my city. Maybe one day."
PE_JLb4EE2lqgJSpCy0KxQ,"Yeah, that's right, I love White Castle. It's nostalgia for me. I feel like a kid in Chicago again every time I bite into one of those tiny littler cheeseburgers.

This spot is on the Strip (next to Walgreens and the Venetian). It's open 24/7. And they serve alcohol too (duh, it's Vegas!).

The staff are always friendly and nice. When it's packed, it can sometimes take awhile to get your order. But most often, your order comes up pretty quick.

Personally, I always opt for one of the meal deals - usually the one with 4 sliders. Both the fries and fried onion thingys are decent choices.

It's also pretty fun people-watching when you come here at like 3am on a weekend."
PEonacpXYv82o-651Vu1kA,Came here expecting to be Amazed with a White Castle burger with my gf it was freezing cold in LV but I was determined to get a White Castle burger after seeing Harry and Kulmar (movie).I walk in wait in line place my order and I wait.They call my number I rush to the counter I even ordered cheese!I sat took a bite and was so disappointed.The microwave WC burgers were better than the actual.Never will I come back in the freezing cold.Bad experience indeed.
uY8ZNqWTRe1N0K3W4BmRlQ,Decent. Expected more but decent Forsure. I don't wanna say overrated but Yelp wouldn't let me leave it at decent ( words min.) so now that I think about it I'm leaning towards overrated.
JGXptdFe7oFbzz8HPBR3rw,"White Castle is a place where you should definitely try in Las Vegas. The sliders are pretty good even though it tastes like Mcdonald's cheeseburgers. I ordered 30 to bring back to San Jose and it comes in a case so you can carry it. So convenient.  

The sliders are small so if you're extremely hungry, 1 would definitely not fill you up."
wt3OwcMQqv_28Wgvue-pxw,"Come to experience it, but don't expect much at all. It's cool to see all the sliders out on the grill but in all honesty, they taste better from the frozen dinner section. Their fries were better than the sliders."
qHMaCSESTGn7lM9lKFqzag,"As a 12 year old boy, my friends and I were obsessed with Harold and Kumar and I mean OBSESSED. We'd watch it every single week after our Sunday league soccer games and always dreamed of going on a road trip to get 100's of those tasty looking  little sliders.

Unfortunately, that dream never did come true but 12 years later the reminiscing angels opened up the heavens and decided to let the King and Queen of White Castle land one of their castles on the Las Vegas strip!! Hallelujah right??! ....OH... HELL.... NO! 

The spot is located inside the Casino Royale  Hotel, right across the street from the Mirage so it's pretty centrally located. It wasn't too busy when we went but it seems like the line goes very fast any ways. Maybe sipping on a fruity Phat Tuesday at the same time as ordering wasn't the brightest idea but either way the food here is absolutely disgusting. 

I was EXTREMELY excited...remembering almost every line from Harold and Kumar as I waited for my food to be ready to grab. That excitement did a complete 180 Right after opening the bag, as it smelled like landfill or some type of sewage leak but of course I ignored it and proceeded to pull a couple regular sliders out of the bag and a chicken ring slider as well. Even though I was really hungry this stuff was so hard to swallow and digest. The sliders are almost as bad as dog food, actually I wouldn't even feed this to a poor little pup. The chicken ring sliders weren't as horrible but still tasted like dry cardboard. 

I now understand why Harold and Kumar craved this place when they were high, because being high has to be the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO ENJOY THE FOOD HERE."
xjPO0o7vcdjsO9eGKZ0vJA,Friendly staff. Expensive food. Not at all that good either. My bread was so soggy on my incredibly small little hamburgers... the only good thing was the fries.
e-tJHGDnbYZtBMButATy7g,"I'm sorry Roldy and Kumar, but this crap is horrible.  I pictured this place being an east coast In N Out in slider form, but the burgers were horrible.  Love the movie, hate the product."
K3WXoBkK8fZi3sy8QH2r9w,"I've heard the White Castles in the East Coast tastes a lot better and I sure hope that's the case because the sliders that I've gotten this past weekend here was not good. The lines are about 20 minutes long and the sliders were similar to the ones you get in the frozen food section. 

Pretty disappointed in this place but I already expected it. The sliders looked like they were just slapped together. The only thing I liked about it was that they came in mini boxes. The meat was small and mysterious. We picked up a bag of hot cheetos to put it in our sliders to cover up the taste and it worked. 

I got the Combo #2 (~$8.99) which includes 4 cheese sliders, fries and a soda. Next time I'll pass on this. 

Overall, will not come back to this location. I would give White Castle another try but in the East Coast."
QXGScWnF-oyVRt61cDHK8A,We got through the line really fast and the service was great. I wish I had ordered more. The burger was great fresh but almost tasted the same as the frozen ones you can buy at the grocery store. I was just happy to see an actual White Castle.
bdqSJCx28WCSlzYZAQakbA,If I could compare the burgers they're pretty much the exact same ones from the freezer section at any grocery store. Unless I was hungover or drunk I'd probably refrain from coming back. Service was great though!
Ppff5yR4dP4xkmBGpV7KYA,My husband and daughter enjoyed the burgers.  I thought the chicken rings were tender and tasted okay.  Chocolate shake was good. We came at a good time and there was only one person in front of us. Fast and cheap food. Glad they opened a chain here in the west coast.
ChnPqYYvxCg4POMe_VpgdA,"I have been a white castle fan since birth in Chicago. I went to this location twice once on April 7th and again on April 8th. Both times I got sick after eating the double cheese burger, this never ever happens to me. The staff was very nice and the wait was short so everything should have been 5 star, but something is wrong here and I could not figure out what is was. Also it would be nice if they had security until 4am there, some of the customers are nut jobs."
Ilb6_hheJP6N7KK7aNNL_Q,"Wow. At least I can say I've knocked White Castle of my bucket list. Even though they make the burgers ""fresh"", I can pretty much say there isn't much difference in taste between these and the frozen ones you can get at the grocery store. The ""beef"" quality is right up there with Taco Bell's mystery beef, no bueno. A 10 pack was like $10. I had two burgers back at my hotel and didn't even finish the rest.

Thanks for the hype Harold and Kumar!! Ya'll should have went to In-N-Out!"
7RnHT-z1WE6xp0k2QK-XYg,"Never had them before but heard about them. This was a must try. So can here at 2am and it was super packed. Well it's located in the middle of the Vegas strip which is why it's crazy busy in there. So ordered the cheese burger combo number 2. The party is thin and the look of it was different from the kind of patty I am used to look at. Bun was soft but from the heat and being in a paper box and it was a bit too soft or bit soggy. Fries were awesome, they tasted so good.


I would come here again maybe. But I am not a big fan of their sliders. Not sure what's the hype."
nloULe9rfuX54JyLZ1DThQ,"MURDER BURGERS, OH HOW IVE MISSED YOU!!

Anyone who has ever eaten a White Castle burger KNOWS they are murder on your stomach, but they are UHMAZING. (Duh, Haven't you ever seen Harold & Kumar, and the lengths they went to just to get a damn slider).
 
Anywho, I have only been able to eat these little suckers from the frozen food section since moving from NY so it was nice to see (and eat) fresh burgers from the stand.  This was the first placed I stopped at and they brought back nostalgia. Chicken Rings, Cheese burger, fries and AGITA (thats HEARTBURN) 

It didnt get 5 stars because the prices are INSANE. 

Also, to make your burgers LESS murderous on your intestines, Order them WITHOUT onions. That's the key :)"
kddUqyVMdsOVhFwOywvPAA,"I love these one- and two-star reviews from people who just don't get what the White Castle experience is supposed to be about. What were you expecting? This ain't In-N-Out.

My only beef with this place - no pun intended, but I could have deleted it and used another phrase if I really wanted to - is that they serve onion chips, which are whole chunks of onion covered in bread crumbs, instead of onion rings, which are built around processed, probably reconstituted onions. It's a nod to quality but I miss the old school rings.

And of course now I want White Castle. The crave is too real."
