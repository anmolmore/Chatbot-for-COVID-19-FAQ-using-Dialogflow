reliable underwater  in murky or even night time  conditions   i m not sure if sound is feasible given the distortion under   water   obviously direction would have to be accurate but range could be  relatively short  i imagine   or    hundred yards would be more than enough     jim mcdonald  refer to patents by james harris rogers

were used extensively during the world war  and was unclassified after the war  supposedly  the government rethought this soon after  and rogers was convieniently forgotten   the bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send half of their signal thru the ground  the half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated  by the square of the distance   but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all  furthermore  the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception  the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise free   if you find this hard to believe  then refer to the work of the man who invented wireless  tesla  tesla confirmed that rogers  methods were correct  while hertzian wave theory was completely  abberant          et    tesla was

a tesla circuit which   was published in an electronics magazine and could have been   the circuit which is referred to here  this one used a   flyback transformer from a tv onto which you wound your own   primary windings  it also used   power transistors in a to              years ago i built a           volt tesla  and the thing was very  spectacular  but besides scaring amazing friends  depending on their  knowledge of science   and generating strong emi  i never found anything  useful that could be done with it      is there any real world application  for tesla coils today      david prutchi  first of all  realize that tesla invented ac power generators  motors  transformers  conductors  etc  technically   all  transformers are tesla coils   in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil  they mean an  air core resonant transformer   the tv flyback version tesla coil  see the  encyclopedia of electronic circuits  v         for diagram  has not an air core  it is of a class of circuit called  oscillating shuttle circuit   osc   generally osc s are highly efficient  but this version uses transistors and resistors  which are very lossy devices  typically tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors  so that he could achieve efficiencies of        and better  the usual application of an air core resonant transformer  or of an osc  is to produce strong emi for wireless broadcasts  how well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the hf hv tesla  flyback  coil from it  if we were to remove from our homes and industries all tesla coils  our lights would go dark  our cars would sputter and die  our radios would go silent  our industries would grind to a halt  and we would have to go back to using coal for heat  gas for lamps  horses for transportation  steam for power  and telegraph for communication  is that real world enough for you         get the message  we would not have       the convieniences we have today if not for tesla  give credit where credit is due   if it had been up to edison  we d still be in the   th century   flame me at your own peril  i m very good at putting edison down          et    tesla was     years ahead of his time  perhaps now his time comes         newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  jml norman vi ri cmu edu subject  re  radar jammers and stealth cars  eric

the mail today the spec sheets on the mil  spec version of exar s xr      timer counter chip  it is stable down to     c and sucks very little power  they show an application for a ultra long time delay  up to several years depending on the rc time constant   in this application  they have two of them cascaded together  the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled  in this configuration  the output is high when the system is reset  when triggered  the output goes low and stays that way for a total of        x the timing cycle of the first chip  the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to       x r x c to        x r x c in     steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output  the beauty of it is  the timebase chip would only have to have a    uf timing cap and a    k resistor for      seconds per timing cycle  so i can get a maximum of             seconds between timing cycles       x        or about    days    of course  that s much more than i need     days   but the counter allows for     binary steps that can be selected for the output for the  pellet puker   after the first    days and it trips  it would reset its self for the next    day timing cycle and so forth   power is still a problem though  a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow  as an insulator  and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack  i like that idea     this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are    volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow  anyway  i ordered the xr      s to see what i can

edu        oh no you re not the only one  analogue scopes give you  or me  at    least  a fair idea of what s going on in a circuit  digital scopes    seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it  e g  even    when there are only a few samples per period  our hp     a displays a    continuous waveform  complete with non existing overshoots  i ve    waded through lots of manual pages and menus  but i haven t found yet    how to turn this off  it doesn t show which points have actually    been measured  as opposed to those which have been interpolated     either   perhaps you re using the wrong brand   sorry all hp fans  but i have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their  excellent  gear    one of the principal functions i look for when considering a dso is whether you can turn interpolation off  the other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i e  being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode          secondly  i don t like menus  i want to see all common functions    with their own button   you ll have guessed i love analogue tek    scopes  i d choose a knob with printed legend over an on screen    display with up down buttons right away  the single knob of most    digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function    at the right moment       i agree with you here  the only consolation is that manufacturers are  beginning  to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus  however  to be fair  it seems that first time scope users  our students  seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a  real  scope         last but not least  you never know if the waveform displayed is old    or recent  noisy or just incoherently modulated  heck  you don t    even know if it really looks the way it s displayed  digital scopes    only show you a tiny fraction of what s going on  most of the time    the re busy computing things   this is one area that newer dsos are addressing  i recently evaluated the latest box from tek   their tds      which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard    mhz analogue cro  this instrument has a    mhz     ms s spec  meaning that it is  always  in real time capture mode  the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range  the downer is that the instrument uses menus again  but at least they appear to be logically laid out         there are only three situations for which i would prefer a digital    scope  looking at what happened before the trigger  looking at rare    events  and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it             let s hope scope manufacturers are listening           best regards     jeroen belleman    jeroen dxcern cern ch  one more thing about the new   simpler   front panels  these instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now  this is a vast improvement over the old oak switch  the single most common cause of failure in our scopes  other than students blowing up inputs   is mechanical wear on these switches  i look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the

drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design     what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer  what they want    to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount    of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a    selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the    snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured    as they come to the different color pellets         the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees     and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and    the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also     two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing    cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of      volts and are small in size  but again  the time of discharge at     or lower    degrees isn t linear  i was thinking of using several timers chained together     to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period  but that blasted cold and    the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain  one possibility would be to    use solar panels  but this is during the six month twilight  anyone have any    good ideas          thanks in advance                wes       firstly  i would never consider trying to make a one shot timer  your  f  cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute  rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current  their performance  in some respects  is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap  the other point is that big electro s are usually rated with         tolerances  so calculating exactly what capacitance you have  particularly when considering the cold    you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain  that  rolls over   from zero to maximum count  or vice versa  once every           seconds  if you were to use something like a    hz clock  you would need a divider chain of       to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period  of course  you could trim the    hz oscillator to give you exact time  but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at     is low anyway   i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit   caveat   i m not experienced in low temperature electronics  so i can t guarantee that this  or any other  approach is the best for inhospitable conditions   johnh

the reference unit used  sometimes  this will be a reference power  such as   milliwatt  given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known  like    ohms in an rf circuit of that impedance   leading to an accepted notation of dbm  maybe it might be dbv  disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed  using   volt as reference  amplitude   rather than reference power   or  it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation  leading to just plain db  so  look at it this way   db  has an implied reference while notation such as  dbm  has an explicit reference   for power     db      log  p measured  p reference     for amplitude    db      log  a measured  a reference      b  is for bel  which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base     named after alexander graham bell  a  deci  bel is      of a bel  it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for the common founder s name  the small  d  large  b  is per si notation convention  i don t know anyone that s been crucified for messing it up   common references for audio are      dbm     milliwatt across     ohms    dbv     volt     vu  a zero on the vu meter       dbm   pro gear line level     vu      dbv  consumer gear line level    often times  a power amp vu meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the   db point  it is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment   note that in a circuit with a given  and maybe unknown  linear impedance  if the amplitude goes up so many decibels  the power will also increase the same amount  this proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm s law

horizontal range probably goes lower than       but   i don t know if it goes all the way down to straight ntsc rate tv  which need   about       khz sweep    as far as  video compatibility   if i m reading   the question right  it won t take anything but analog rgb inputs   in other   words  it has no way to decode ntsc or y c video inputs   you would need   some sort of board to to this

collected works  vol  v  reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone   we plan    to have a full size     binary digit  word hold either contain   full size number      equivalent to    decimal digits  but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign  or two     binary digit  orders        it should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders  i e  the machine s ability to modify its own orders  under the control of other ones among its orders  is absolutely necessary for a flexible code  thus  if part of the memory is used as a  function table   then  looking up  a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify  or rather make up  the reference to the memory in the order which controls this  looking up   and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question   on the other hand  this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non trivial operation which we have to view it as    david cary  tenor  e  and comp

on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets    the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees   and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and  the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also   two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing  cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of    volts and are small in size    why are you fooling around with analog for this job   a single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily   an      only costs about      that and a    crystal and you re in business   embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket  power it from a solar cell  use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness   if you don t want to try thermal management  contact someone like icl and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal   it ll cost at most       if you use a single chip micro  you re looking at a parts count of  maybe     a processor  a crystal  two caps on the crystal  a power fet to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery   this is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable   add a power zener diode  for heat  and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to     pd assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros   this application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer s guide and create the binary with a hex editor   john     john de armond  wd oqc                interested in high

step the   vac supply voltage up to approx     vdv  as the load resistance increases  the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops  i need as high an output voltage as possible   about    v     the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages  ie    diodes and    capacitors  each capacitor develops about   v across them  and i take the output from across seven capacitors    v    each capacitor is    mfd at   v   if i increase each of the capacitors rating         mfd   that will increase the rc constant  and hence alleviate some of the problem  these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need    of them  so      what would happen if i connected a    mfd at    v capacitor in parallel  with the output  and hence in parallel with the seven    mfd capacitors     will it  as i assume  increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant  if it does  and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this  then i will have killed two birds with one stone    as i am experiencing some   hz ripple  and hence amp hum   and this new capacitor will  smooth  this out   and    can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor  choke  to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the   hz mains hum  lowest resistance possible      i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction      i m

bells and whistles  including soft keys  which i think are a    loveley touch    that is  software keys    you don t forget that you    are dealing with a computer  those scopes even with all their    neatness  still make the ickyest looking waves  lotsa features  but    ugly output  and those are the best digitals i have ever seen  i ve    seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible   i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis  and some of the functions are typically presented  in my opinion  in a counter intuitive fashion  hp has made some strides in their       series  imo   automatic setups are fine for simple  repetitive waveforms  but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring processing the event  for example  is the scope in  equivalent time  or in  real time  sampling mode  equivalent time being a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep   what was the scope s actual sampling rate at the time  how is the data being massaged after capture but before display  etc  one common misconception is the speed of the scope   is the hp scope you re using really a     mhz scope  or is it a    mhz sample rate scope     mhz single shot significance  whose front end including s h can support     mhz waveforms  important for equivalent time sampling   the     mhz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive  or on a single sample  when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time   so  there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope  i prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where i need storage for later analysis or comparison  when the event is within the capability of the scope  now  for the price of true     mhz digital scopes to fall                                                                                     dave medin   phone                  w      ssd  networking                    h

khz    passband     close  but no banana  to paraphrase garfield      the reason          hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy   khz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line  therefore     hz at the  bottom  and    hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise  interference with the next band     nowadays  digital trunks have made this less relevant  but the phone  companies still see no reason to improve quality  especially for free     therefore  digital  chunk of a trunk  segments still have a guaranteed  bandwidth of only  khz  so they can carry the equivalent of one

design   what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer  what they want  to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets     the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees   and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and  the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also   two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing  cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of    volts and are small in size  but again  the time of discharge at     or lower  degrees isn t linear  i was thinking of using several timers chained together  to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period  but that blasted cold and  the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain  one possibility would be to  use solar panels  but this is during the six month twilight  anyone have any  good ideas      thanks in advance            wes        just a suggestion  take a motorola mc     b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a rc or xtal clock input  then feed to a mc     b as clock input and decode output for           sec output  might have to add a few  and  gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the     to restart cycle    trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge  the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher   these ckts require uamps of current between        volts  so a    volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks  then take the ckt board   battery wrap in    or    of foam or build a box of out of the stuff   with plywood or metal exterior    build a small heater out of       watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm   nd thought use   batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger   insolate insolate       even though the chips state that the   al rated devices are good to     c   the batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity   oh make sure the area

passive  device much like the radio in your car   they work as an antenna picking  up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out   therefore there would  be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of  detecting whether some one had a radio in their car       from my rather rusty knowledge of radio  most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit  so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator  giving  a fixed intermediate frequency  if  that is more easily amplified  the detector detectors work by picking up if re radiated from your radar  detector  in britain  where one has used to pay for a tv licence  there  are were tv detector vans prowling the streets  looking for people who hadn t  paid their licence fee  they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof  and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if    i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna  and  how much from the rest of the module

applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole  and it is a   subtle question   the longer one works with them  the more real they   become   there are also quasi particles  which raise the

only exist in certain    semi conductors  the question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semi conductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor  say  copper      i don t want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors  rather i ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such

there i have to figure that in  it s kind of a pain in  the ass   is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem  the box would tkae the function generator

was built just last year  and the breaker box is wired the  same way      there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground in the breaker box   there also should be a connection of the neutral wire to a ground in the breaker box   there should be no other  place in the building where such a connection occurs  i e  not in any of the outlet boxes     the neutral  white  wire is a  grounding conductor  for the plug  and is not safe to touch  while the ground  green  wire is a  protective ground  and carries no current unless some kind of electrical fault has occurred   it s safe to touch the protective ground  but not to touch the  grounding conductor  because there is current in the grounding conductor  its outlet box end will not be at the same ground potential as its

to know if such a ground plane is also necessary in an analog  system      note  this ground plane will not be connected  except at one point  to  the signal ground      i keep getting conflicting answers over this  does having a ground plane  in an analog system help reduce noise also  my system only deals with  low frequency signals  up to    hz only       well  one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do   a continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield   do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things   this shielding won t do much good for magnetic fields  unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded  like a faraday cage   the flip side of the coin   if you are working with  very  high impedances  you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems  you aren t likely to encounter this at    hz  but at   khz  it can be a real problem

an led in series with a zener say around   v         on hook   led on        off hook   led off         would this work  if anyone tries tried it  please let me know              aye  there s the rub    if you draw enough current to light an led  the       equipment at the phone company will think you ve gone off hook        in the on hook state you re not supposed to draw current           which means you should just use your digital voltmeter  you can use an     old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think     there s something wrong with the cable              look guys  what s the problem here   if you want a light that goes on when     the  phone is  off  hook  all you need it to run it in  series  with the     line  as i mentioned in my previous post   if you want a light that goes on     when the  phone is  on  hook  all you need is a voltage threshold detector     if you re going to do the series diode thing  which is the easiest   just  make sure that the led can take the current  i can t recall it off hand  but  it s something like    ma or more    careful now folks    also consider the   vac     hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone s supposed to ring   even with a simple zener and led setup  you might end up with some carbon real quick   whatever scheme you use  make sure you ve got at least    v rated components on  the frontend   also remember that  if i m not mistaken  the phone line is a    ohm equivalent circuit   any current you draw from the   v or so gets dropped across that    ohms   that s fine until you re

something that made it sound like  you didn t realize something   on a typical ups  well  on ours  anyway    there is no switchover from ac to dc   all the protected equipment is  always running from the batteries  via an inverter   with the usual   condition of also having them on charge   if the power fails  big deal     the computers never see it  until the batteries start to droop  but   there s something like    car sized batteries in that cabinet  so it   takes a while      if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter   why not do it all the time   then there d be no switchover to screw  things up  and no having to sense the failure fast   just keep the dc  on charge when the power is on  and it ll be there in zero time when  you  need  it     actually  it s a bit more complicated than that   i sounds to me  your ups takes in ac  rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries  and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again  feeding your equipment   this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since  as you mentioned  nothing will know about what happened down the line   another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power  and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power   the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat   unfortunately  most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available  so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable   ya sorta have to make it work with what there already   similar story with our telephone system   it was first invented back in the      s   we re still using the same damn system  media  as they did back then   if i have

we re wrong   we invite you to correct us  but please   quote references    the nec and the cec do not  in and of themselves  have the  force of law   many municipalities adopt it en toto   others   however  do not   check your with your local building  department  and  provincial  hydro inspection offices in  canada  to find out what applies in your area   also   your local electrical utility may also have special requirements  for electrical service installation   bear in mind  too  that  we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family  residences   multi family dwellings  mobile homes  commercial  establishments  etc   are sometimes governed by different  rules    also note that  contrary to popular belief in the u s   and in  some parts of canada   canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary  of the u s   consequently  the nec does not apply in canada   lots of things are the same  including voltages  line  frequencies  and the laws of physics   but there are a number  of crucial differences in the regulations   where we can  we ve  noted them  flagging the relevant passages with   nec   or    cec      remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards   it is often  smart to go beyond their minimal requirements   subject  what is the nec   where can i get a copy    the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the  national fire protection association  an insurance industry group   it s revised every three years   the      version has been released   you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore  or by calling them directly  at                the code exists in several versions   there s the  full text  which is fairly incomprehensible   there s an abridged  edition  which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses   and there s the nec handbook  which contains the   authorized  commentary   on the code  as well as the full text   that s the  recommended version   unfortunately  there s no handbook for  the abridged edition   and the full handbook is expensive     us    plus shipping and handling   subject  what is the cec   where can i get a copy    the canadian standards association is an organization made up  of various government agencies  power utilities  insurance  companies  electrical manufacturers and other organizations   the csa publishes csa standard c     which is updated every two  or three years   each province adopts  with some amendments   this standard and publishes a province specific code book   since each province publishes its own slightly modified  standard  it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa  standard itself   in this faq   cec  really means the  appropriate provincial standard   in particular  this faq is  derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code    th  edition          which is in turn based on csa c             th  edition    while differences exist between the provinces  an  attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail    the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical  inspection offices of your provincial power authority   in  ontario  it s ontario hydro   the ontario hydro book isn t  overly fat   it s about c     and includes mailed updates   i  hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the  equivalent nec publications    don t bother asking in quebec   diy wiring is banned throughout  the province   subject  can i do my own wiring   extra pointers    in most places  homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring   in some  they re not   check with your local electrical  inspector   most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s  homes for money without a license   nor are you permitted to do  wiring in  commercial  buildings   multiple dwellings  eg  duplexes   are usually considered  semi commercial  or  commercial    however   many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial  wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician   if you can  find one willing to supervise    if you do your own wiring  an important point    do it neat and well   what you really want to aim for is a better  job than an electrician will do   after all  it s your own home   and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make  a mistake   an electrician has time pressures  has the skills  and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast  safe job   in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that  are in excess of code  because we feel that it s reasonable   and will impress the inspector    the inspector will know that you re an amateur   you have to  earn his trust   the best way of doing this is to spend your  time doing as neat a job as possible   don t cut corners   exceed specifications   otherwise  the inspector may get extremely  picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions    don t try to hide anything from the inspector    use the proper tools   ie  don t use a bread knife to strip  wires  or twist wires with your fingers   the inspector  won t like it  and the results won t be that safe   and it  takes longer   and you re more likely to stick a hunk of    ga wire through your hand that way    don t handle house wire when it s very cold  eg  below    c  or   f    thermoplastic house wire  particularly older types  become very brittle   subject  what do i need in the way of tools    first  there s the obvious    a hammer  a drill  a few  screwdrivers  both straight and phillips head   if you re   lucky enough to live in canada  or find a source of csa approved  devices  you need robertson   square recess   screwdrivers      and     instead of phillips    for drilling a few holes  a      or    spade bit and      or       electric drill will do   if you re doing a lot  or  are working with elderly lumber  we recommend a      drill   right angle drills are wonderful   can be rented  and       or    screw point auger drill bits   these bits pull  you through  so they re much faster and less fatiguing  even  in    year old hardwood timbers    screw driver bits are useful for drills  expecially if you  install your electrical boxes using screws  drywall screws  work well      for stripping wire  use a real wire stripper  not a knife or  ordinary wire cutters   don t buy the    k mart  combo stripper   crimper and bottle opener  types   you should expect to pay      to     for a good  plier type  pair   it will have sized  stripping holes  and won t nick or grab the wire   it should  be easy to strip wire with it   one model has a small hole in the  blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals   there  are fancier types  autostrip cut   but they generally aren t  necessary  and pros usually don t use them    a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends  in constricted places   don t use these for stripping wire    you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts    you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling  inside boxes and closing loops  but it s better to form wire  loops with a  loop former hole  on your wire stripper   more  accurate    if you re using non metallic cable  get a cable stripper for  removing the sheath   or  do what some pros do  they nick the  end of the sheath  grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers   and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a   zipper   and cut the sheath off   you shouldn t try to strip  the sheath with a knife point  because it s too easy to  slash the insulation on the conductors   apparently stanley  utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters  hooked blades   can be used to strip sheath  but there is still the possibility  that you ll gouge the conductors    for any substantial amount of work with armored cable  it s well  worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter   us        hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire  or the insulation    three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired  outlets   about      multimeters tell you more  but are a lot more  expensive  and probably not worth it for most people   a simple  voltage sensor  which can detect potential through an insulated  wire not supplying any devices  is extremely helpful  they cost  about us     at radio shack    you should have a voltage detector   to check that the wires are  dead before doing work on them   neon bulb version are cheap         and work well   if you get more serious  a  audible alarm  type is  good for tracing circuits without a helper    though i ve been known  to lock the drill on  and hit breakers until the scream stops       for running wires through existing walls  you need fish tape   often  two tapes are needed  though sometimes  a bent hanger or  a length of thin chain will suffice   fish tapes can be rented    electrical tape   lots of it      seriously  a good and competent  wiring job will need very little tape   the tape is useful for  wrapping dicy insulation in repair work   another use is to wrap   around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination  screws   i don t do this  but drywall contractors prefer it  to  prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet  that has no cover plate    subject  what is ul listing    the ul stands for  underwriters laboratory    it used to be  an insurance industry organization  but now it is independent  and non profit   it tests electrical components and equipment  for potential hazards   when something is ul listed  that means  that the ul has tested the device  and it meets their requirements  for safety   ie  fire or shock hazard   it doesn t necessarily  mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to  just  that it probably won t kill you    the ul does not have power of law in the u s     you are  permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices   however   insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will  limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to  the failure of a non ul listed device   furthermore  in  many situations the nec will require that a wiring component  used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose   indirectly  this means that certain parts of your wiring  must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or  occupancy permits issued    subject  what is csa approval    every electrical device or component must be certified by the  canadian standards association before it can be sold in  canada   implicit in this is that all wiring must be done  with csa approved materials   they perform testing similar to  the ul  a bit more stringent   except that csa approval is  required by law    again  like the ul  if a fire was caused by non csa approved  equipment  your insurance company may not have to pay the  claim    in canada  there is a branch organization of the ul  called ulc   ul of canada    ulc does not have power of law  and seems to  be more a liason group between the csa and insurance  companies   subject  are there any cheaper  easier to read books on wiring    usa  the following three books were suggested by our readers       residential wiring      by jeff markell       craftsman books       carlsbad ca for         isbn                      practical electrical wiring      residential  farm and industrial   based on the national      electrical code    ansi nfpa         herbert p  richter and w  creighton schwan      mcgraw hill book co        wiring simplified      h  p  richter and w  c  schwan      park publishing co     try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec  revision   which is currently         canada  p s  knight authors and publishes a book called   electrical code simplified    there appears to be a version  published specific to each province  and is very tied into the  appropriate provincial code   it focuses on residential wiring   and is indispensible for canadian diy ers   it is better to get  this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring  or answer  questions on the net        it is updated each time the provincial codes are   this book is  available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c      subject  inspections how and what   why should i get my wiring inspected    most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and  inspections of any wiring that is done   amongst other more  mundane bureaucratic reasons  like insurance companies not  liking to have to pay claims   a permit and inspections  provides some assurance that you  your family  your neighbors  or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose  their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job    most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your  home  or order you to tear out any wiring done without a  permit   california  for instance  is particularly nasty about  this    if fire starts in your home  and un inspected wiring is at  fault  insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage  claims    in general  the process goes like this      you apply to your local inspections office or building     department for a permit   you should have a sketch or     detailed drawing of what you plan on doing   this is     a good time to ask questions on any things you re not     sure of   if you re doing major work  they may impose     special conditions on you  require loading     calculations and ask other questions   at this point     they will tell you which inspections you will need      if you re installing a main panel  you will need to     have the panel and service connections inspected     before your power utility will provide a connection      this is sometimes done by the local power authority     rather than the usual inspectors      after installing the boxes and wiring  but before     the insulation walls go up  you will need a      rough in  inspection      after the walls are up  and the wiring is complete      you will need a  final inspection    subject  my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations   do i have to upgrade    in general  there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings   though there are some exceptions  ie  smoke detectors in some  cases    however  any new work must be done according to the  latest electrical code   also  if you do   major   work  you  may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all  of your system   check with your local electrical inspector   subject  a word on voltages                                one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the  different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of  a circuit   one person might talk about    v  another    v  or another    v   these are all  in fact  exactly the same  thing     in north america the utility companies are required  to supply a split phase     volt        feed to your house   this works out as two    v       legs   additionally  since there  are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring  it s not  unreasonable to find    v has dropped to    v or    v has dropped  to    v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet   especially  at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run   for a number  of reasons  some historical  some simple personal orneryness   different people choose call them by slightly different numbers   this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them     v  and      v   except when actually saying what the measured voltage will  be   confusing   a bit   just ignore it    one thing that might make this a little more understandable  is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower  ie     v  instead of    v  value   what this implies is that the device  is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that  low       v is  not  the same as    v      v is the voltage between  phases of a   phase  y  circuit that is    v from neutral to any  hot       v is the voltage between phases of a   phase  y   circuit that s    v from hot to neutral    in keeping with    v versus    v strangeness  motors intended  to run on    v three phase are often labelled as    v     subject  what does an electrical service look like    there are logically four wires involved with supplying the  main panel with power   three of them will come from the utility  pole  and a fourth  bare  wire comes from elsewhere     the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded   into the ground  or to a wire buried in the foundation  or sometimes   to the water supply pipe  has to be metal  continuous to where  the main water pipe entering the house   watch out for galvanic  action conductivity  breaks   often between copper and iron pipe     this is the  grounding conductor    it is there to make sure that  the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground   this wire  normally carries no current    one of the other wires will be white  or black with white or  yellow stripes  or sometimes simply black    it is the neutral wire   it is connected to the  centre tap   cec   center tap  in the  nec  of the distribution transformer supplying the power   it  is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place  often  inside the panel    the neutral and ground should not be connected  anywhere else   otherwise  weird and or dangerous things may happen    furthermore  there should only be one grounding system in  a home   some codes require more than one grounding electrode   these will be connected together  or connected to the neutral  at a common point   still one grounding system   adding additional  grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house  wiring is unsafe and contrary to code    if you add a subpanel  the ground and neutral are usually  brought as separate conductors from the main panel  and are  not connected together in the subpanel  ie  still only one  neutral ground connection    however  in some situations    certain categories of separate buildings  you actually do  have to provide a second grounding electrode   consult your  inspector    the other two wires will usually be black  and are the  hot   wires   they are attached to the distribution transformer as  well    the two black wires are     degrees out of phase with each  other   this means if you connect something to both hot wires   the voltage will be     volts   if you connect something to the  white and either of the two blacks you will get    v    some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them   this is either because the neutral and ground are connected  together at a different point  eg  the meter or pole  and one  wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground  or in some  rare occasions  the service has only one hot wire     v only  service    subject  what is a circuit    inside the panel  connections are made to the incoming wires   these connections are then used to supply power to selected  portions of the home   there are three different combinations       one hot  one neutral  and ground     v circuit       two hots  no neutral  and ground     v circuit       two hots  neutral  and ground     v circuit   neutral       and or two    v circuits with a common neutral        is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and  lighting within your house       is usually used for supplying  power to major appliances such as stoves  and dryers   they  often have need for both    v and    v  or for bringing several  circuits from the panel box to a distribution point       is  usually for special    v motor circuits  electric heaters  or  air conditioners     note  in the us  the nec frequently permits a circuit similar  to     be used for stoves and dryers   namely  that there  are two hot wires  and a wire that does dual duty as neutral  and ground  and is connected to the frame as well as providing  the neutral for    v purposes   three prong plugs instead  of four   only  for stoves dryers connected to the main panel   when connected to most sub panels    prong plugs and receptacles  are required    in our not so humble opinion this is crazy  but  the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the      nec   and found to be safe   check your local codes  or inquire as to  local practice    there are restrictions on when this is  permissible         is usually wired with three conductor wire  black for hot   white for neutral  and bare for grounding        and     have one hot wire coloured red  the other black  a  bare wire for grounding  and in     a white wire for neutral    you will sometimes see     wired with just a black  white and ground  wire   since the white is  hot  in this case  both the nec and cec  requires that the white wire be  permanently marked  at the ends  to indicate that it is a live wire   usually done with paint  nail  polish or sometimes electrical tape    each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the  panel through a circuit breaker or fuse    there are  in a few locales  circuits that look like           or     except that they have two bare ground wires   some places  require this for hot tubs and the like  one ground is  frame ground    the other attaches to the motor    this may or may not be an  alternative to gfci protection   subject   grounding  versus  grounded  versus  neutral     according to the terminology in the cec and nec  the   grounding  conductor is for the safety ground  i e   the green  or bare wire   the word  neutral  is reserved for the white when  you have a circuit with more than one  hot  wire   since the white  wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the  panel  the proper term is  grounded conductor    however  the  potential confusion between  grounded conductor  and  grounding  conductor  can lead to potentially lethal mistakes   you should  never use the bare wire as a  grounded conductor  or white wire  as the  grounding conductor   even though they are connected  together in the panel     but not in subpanels   subpanels are fed neutral and ground  separately from the main panel   usually     in the trade  and in common usage  the word  neutral  is used  for  grounded conductor    this faq uses  neutral  simply to  avoid potential confusion   we recommend that you use  neutral   too   thus the white wire is always  except in some light  switch applications  neutral   not ground   subject  what does a fuse or breaker do   what are the differences    fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power  to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels   for  example  if your toaster shorts out  a fuse or breaker should   trip   protecting the wiring in the walls from melting   as  such  fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the  wiring    ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the  equipment itself won t cause a fire    fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt   safely  when the current exceeds the rated value  thereby  interrupting the power to the circuit   fuses trip relatively  fast   which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have  large startup current surges   for motor circuits  you can use  a  time delay  fuse  one brand is  fusetron   which will avoid  tripping on momentary overloads   a fusetron looks like a  spring loaded fuse   a fuse can only trip once  then it must be  replaced    breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices   they  usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched  into position against another contact   when the current flow  through the device exceeds the rated value  a bimetallic strip  heats up and bends   by bending it  trips  the latch  and the  spring pulls the contacts apart   circuit breakers behave  similarly to fusetrons   that is  they tend to take longer to  trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses   with high  overloads  they trip quickly   breakers can be reset a finite  number of times   each time they trip  or are thrown  when the circuit is in use  some arcing takes place  which  damages the contacts   thus  breakers should not be used in  place of switches unless they are specially listed for the  purpose    neither fuses nor breakers  limit  the current per se   a dead  short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even  thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time  which  can often cause severe damage   subject  breakers   can t i use fuses    statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher  risk of causing a fire than breaker panels   this is usually  due to the fuse being loosely screwed in  or the contacts  corroding and heating up over time  or the wrong size fuse  being installed  or the proverbial  replace the fuse with a  penny  trick    since breakers are more permanently installed  and have better  connection mechanisms  the risk of fire is considerably less    fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload   when  a fuse explodes  the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting  path   result  from complete meltdown of the electrical panel   melted service wiring  through fires in the electrical  distribution transformer and having your house burn down   breakers don t do this    many jurisdictions  particularly in canada  no longer permit  fuse panels in new installations   the nec does permit new  fuse panels in some rare circumstances  requiring the special  inserts to  key  the fuseholder to specific size fuses    some devices  notably certain large air conditioners  require fuse  protection in addition to the breaker at the panel   the fuse  is there to protect the motor windings from overload   check the  labeling on the unit   this is usually only on large permanently  installed motors   the installation instructions will tell you  if you need one   subject  what size wire should i use    for a    amp circuit  use    gauge wire   for a    amp circuit   you can use    gauge wire  in most locales    for a long run   though  you should use the next larger size wire  to avoid  voltage drops      gauge is only slightly more expensive than     gauge  though it s stiffer and harder to work with    here s a quick table for normal situations   go up a size for  more than     foot runs  when the cable is in conduit  or  ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate  heat easily     gauge  amps                                               we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent  on the application and precise wire type   subject  where do these numbers come from    there are two considerations  voltage drop and heat buildup   the smaller the wire is  the higher the resistance is   when  the resistance is higher  the wire heats up more  and there is  more voltage drop in the wiring   the former is why you need  higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in  conduit  the latter is why you should use larger wire for long  runs    neither effect is very significant over very short distances   there are some very specific exceptions  where use of smaller  wire is allowed   the obvious one is the line cord on most  lamps   don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits  one of those exceptions  you can never go wrong by using larger  wire   subject  what does        mean    this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors  in a cable   the first number specifies the gauge   the second  the number of current carrying conductors in the wire   but  remember there s usually an extra ground wire          means     gauge  two insulated current carrying wires  plus bare ground       wire usually has a black  white and bare ground wire   sometimes  the white is red instead for    v circuits without neutral   in  the latter case  the sheath is usually red too       wire usually has a black  red  white and bare ground wire   usually carrying    v with neutral   subject  what is a  wirenut   marrette   marr connector    how are they  used    a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used  to connect wires together    marrette  or  marr connector   are trade names   you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring    in essence  you strip the end of the wires about an inch  twist them  together  then twist the wirenut on    though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the  wire  do it anyways   it s more mechanically and electrically  secure    there are many different sizes of wire nut   you should check  that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the  quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together    don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or  your fingers   use a pair of blunt nose   linesman   pliers   and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly   sometimes  it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it  goes in the wirenut properly    some people wrap the  open  end of the wirenut with electrical  tape   this is probably not a good idea   the inspector may  tear it off during an inspection   it s usually done because  a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut   instead  of taping it  the connection should be redone   subject  what is a gfi gfci    a gfci is a   ground fault circuit interrupter     it measures  the current current flowing through the hot wire and the  neutral wire   if they differ by more than a few milliamps  the  presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other  path   this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of  an appliance  or to the ground lead  or through a person   any  of these situations is hazardous  so the gfci trips  breaking  the circuit    gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks   if   for example  you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral  leads of a circuit  and no part of you was grounded  a gfci  wouldn t help   all of the current that passed from the hot  lead into you would return via the neutral lead  keeping the  gfci happy    the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric   one is labeled load  the other  line   the incoming power feed   must  be connected to the line side  or the outlet will not be  protected   the load side can be used to protect all devices  downstream from it   thus  a whole string of outlets can be  covered by a single gfci outlet   subject  where should gfcis be used    the nec mandates gfcis for    v    a or   a single phase  outlets  in bathrooms  kitchens within    of the sink  garages   unfinished basements or crawl spaces  outdoors  near a pool  or  just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water  or dampness   there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets   those dedicated to appliances   occupying fixed space     typically refrigerators and freezers  and for sump pumps and  laundry appliances    the cec does not mandate as many gfcis   in particular  there  is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets  or most garage or  basement outlets   basement outlets must be protected if you  have a dirt floor  garage outlets if they re near the door to  outside   bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis    even if you are not required to have gfci protection  you may  want to consider installing it anyway   unless you need a gfci  breaker  see below   the cost is low   in the u s   gfci  outlets can cost as little as us      costs are a bit higher in  canada   c       evaluate your own risk factors   does your  finished basement ever get wet   do you have small children   do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools   does  water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage   subject  where shouldn t i use a gfci    gfcis are generally not used on circuits that  a  don t pose a  safety risk  and  b  are used to power equipment that must run  unattended for long periods of time   refrigerators  freezers   and sump pumps are good examples   the rationale is that gfcis  are sometimes prone to nuisance trips   some people claim that  the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary  current imbalance  tripping the gfci   note  though  that most  gfci trips are real  if you re getting a lot of trips for no  apparent reason  you d be well advised to check your wiring  before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless   subject  what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker    for most situations  you can use either a gfci outlet as the  first device on the circuit  or you can install a breaker with  a built in gfci   the former is generally preferred  since gfci  breakers are quite expensive   for example  an ordinary ge  breaker costs  us    the gfci model costs  us      there is one  major exception   if you need to protect a   multi wire branch  circuit    two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire    such as a canadian style kitchen circuit  you ll need a  multi pole gfci breaker   unfortunately  these are expensive   the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars  depending on  what brand of panel box you have   but if you must protect such  a circuit  say  for a pool heater   you have no choice    one more caveat    gfci outlets are bulky   you may want to use  an oversize box when installing them   on second thought  use  large  actually deep  boxes everywhere   you ll thank yourself for it    incidentally  if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one  specific outlet is protected  such as a bathroom   you don t  really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first  outlet in the circuit  you could simply find the first outlet  in the bathroom  and not gfci anything upstream of it   but  protecting the whole circuit is preferred    when you install a gfci  it s a good idea to use the little   ground fault protected  stickers that come with it and mark  the outlets downstream of the gfci   you can figure out which  outlets are  downstream   simply by tripping the gfci with the  test button and see which outlets are dead   subject  what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet  then    apart from their use in electronics  which we won t comment on   and for certain fluorescent lights  they won t turn on without  a good ground connection   they re intended to guard against  insulation failures within the device   generally  the case of  the appliance is connected to the ground lead   if there s an  insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case  the  ground lead conducts the electricity away safely  and possibly  trips the circuit breaker in the process    if the case is not  grounded and such a short occurs  the case is live    and if  you touch it while you re grounded  you ll get zapped   of  course  if the circuit is gfci protected  it will be a very  tiny zap    which is why you can use gfcis to replace  ungrounded outlets  both nec and cec     there are some appliances that should  never  be grounded   in  particular  that applies to toasters and anything else with  exposed conductors   consider   if you touch the heating  electrode in a toaster  and you re not grounded  nothing will  happen   if you re slightly grounded  you ll get a small shock   the resistance will be too high   but if the case were  grounded  and you were holding it  you d be the perfect path to  ground     subject  why is one prong wider than the other   polarization   nowadays  many two prong devices have one prong wider than the  other   this is so that the device could rely  not guaranteed    on one specific wire being neutral  and the other hot   this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures  where the  the shell should neutral  safety   or other devices which want to  have an approximate ground reference  ie  some radios     most   prong extension cords have wide prongs too    this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right  way around   you want the wide prong to be neutral  and the  narrow one hot   most outlets have a darker metal for the  hot screw  and lighter coloured screw for the neutral   if not  you can usually figure out which is which by which  prong the terminating screw connects to   subject  what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen    the nec requires at least two    amp   small appliance  circuits   for kitchens   the cec requires split duplex  receptacles   outlets must be installed such that no point is more  than      nec       mm cec  from an outlet   every counter wider  than      nec  or     mm  cec  must have at least one outlet   the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except  in the kitchen  pantry  or dining room   furthermore  these circuits  are in addition to any required for refrigerators  stoves  microwaves   lighting  etc   non dedicated outlets within    of a sink  must  be  protected by a gfci  nec only     split duplex receptacles are fed with a    v circuit   the tab  is broken on the hot side of the outlet  and one hot goes to  the upper outlet  and the other hot goes to the lower outlet   the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw   when   carrying through  to another outlet  the neutral must be  pigtailed  such that removing the outlet  or having the neutral  connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect  from downstream outlets   subject  where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms    there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom  adjacent to  the sink  in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in  the light fixture   all such outlets  must  be gfci protected   subject  what is romex nm nmd   what is bx   when should i use each    romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire   sometimes called non metallic sheath   the formal name is nm   this is suitable for use in dry  protected areas  ie  inside  stud walls  on the sides of joists etc    that are not subject  to mechanical damage or excessive heat   most newer homes are  wired almost exclusively with nm wire   there are several  different categories of nm cable    bx cable    technically known as armored cable or  ac  has a  flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is  fairly resistant to damage    teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic  sheath     protection for cable in concealed locations  where nm or ac cable  is run through studs  joists or similar wooden members  the outer  surface of the cable must be kept at least   mm        cec   nec   from the edges of the wooden members  or the cable should be protected  from mechanical injury   this latter protection can take the form of  metal plates  such as spare outlet box ends  or conduit     note  inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored  cable  or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection   but this is technically illegal     additional protection recommendations  these are rules in the  canadian codes   they are reasonable answers to the vague  references to  exposed to mechanical damage  in both the nec  and cec           nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage        where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls        in exposed locations under   feet from the floor         ie  use ac instead  flexible conduit  wooden guards etc         where cable is suspended  as in  connections to furnaces        or water heaters  the wire should be protected   canadian        practise is usually to install a junction or outlet        box on the wall  and use a short length of ac cable        or nm cable in flexible conduit to  jump  to the appliance         stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used         where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating        ducts or pipe  heat transfer should be minimized by        means of a   mm    air space  or suitable insulation        material  a wad of fiberglass          nm cable shall be supported within    mm    of every box        or fitting  and at intervals of no more than    m            holes in joists or studs are considered  supports          some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to        each box    while fishing cable is technically in violation         it is permitted where  proper  support is impractical           conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge          knight also insists on only one cable per staple  referring        to the  workmanship  clause  but this seems more honoured        in the breach            cable should never be buried in plaster  cement or        similar finish         cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards         cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists        or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more        than  m          whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp  small  plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to  prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through  the insulation    bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by  solid wall coverings    in places where damage is more likely  like on the back wall of  a garage      you may be required to use conduit  a  ul   or csa   approved metal pipe   you use various types of  fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the  wire    service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit    in damp places  eg  buried wiring to outdoor lighting  you will  need special wire  eg  cec nmw    nec uf    nmw   looks like  very heavy duty nmd     you will usually need short lengths of  conduit where the wire enters exits the ground    see underground  wiring section      thermoplastic sheath wire  such as nm  nmw etc   should not be   exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that   purpose    many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through  furnace ducts  including cold air return plenums constructed  by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces    the reason for this  is that if there s a fire  the ducting will spread toxic gasses  from burning insulation very rapidly through the building   teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas      canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us    except that canadian wire designations usually include the   temperature rating in celsius   eg   ac    versus  ac    in the us  nm b is    degrees celcius    note  local codes vary   this is one of the items that changes  most often   eg  chicago codes require conduit  everywhere    there are very different requirements for mobile homes   check your local codes   especially  if you re doing anything  that s the slightest out of the ordinary    wire selection table  incomplete   the real tables are enormous   uncommon wire types or applications omitted    condition   type cec nec   exposed concealed dry  plastic nmd   nm      armor ac   ac       teck     exposed

boxes    the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable  only   the reasoning is simple    with armored cable  the box  itself provides ground conductor continuity   u s  plastic  boxes don t use metal cable clamps    the cec is slightly different   the cec never permits cable  armor as a grounding conductor   however  you must still  provide ground continuity for metallic sheath   the cec also  requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes    the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for  non metallic sheathed cable    you can avoid making one ground  connection and they sometimes cost a little less   on the other  hand  plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts   for  exposed or shop wiring  metal boxes are probably better   subject  junction box positioning    a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together    junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible  later   ie  not buried under plaster   excessive use of junction  boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation  and inspectors may  get nasty   subject  can i install a replacement light fixture    in general  one can replace fixtures freely  subject to a few  caveats   first  of course  one should check the amperage  rating of the circuit   if your heart is set on installing half  a dozen     watt floodlights  you may need to run a new wire  back to the panel box   but there are some more subtle  constraints as well   for example  older house  wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation   the excess  heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the  insulation to deteriorate and crack  with obvious bad results   some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high  temperature wire only    you may find  in fact  that your  ceiling wiring already has this problem  in which case  replacing any devices is a real adventure     other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some  fluorescent fixtures  and making sure that the ceiling box and  its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy  chandelier or ceiling fan   you may need to install a new box  specifically listed for this purpose   a  x  across the ceiling  joists makes a good support   metal brackets are also available  that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and  mounted between the joists    there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as   pot  lamps or heat lamps   when these are installed in insulated  ceilings  they can present a very substantial fire hazard   the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated  ceilings  provided that the fixture is boxed in a  coffin   usually    x   x      made by making a pair of joists     high  and covering  with plywood  that doesn t have any insulation    yes  that s    feet   long    nec rules are somewhat less stringent   they require at least     clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation   the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement   which means that a cec style   coffin   might be worthwhile   presumably  that s up to the local inspector    the cec doesn t  actually mandate the coffin per se  this seems to be an inspector  requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get  accidentally buried in insulation   ie  if you have insulation blown  in later     there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and  fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation   they are  usually limited to    watt bulbs  and are unfortunately  somewhat  more expensive than the older types   before you use them  you should  ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses   follow the installation instructions carefully  the prescribed location  for the sensor can vary    there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved  for use in insulation   the  coffin  appears the only legal approach   subject  what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts    this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is  loose   depending on the load balance  one hot wire may end up  being more than    v  and the other less than    v  with  respect to ground   this is a very hazardous situation   it can  destroy your electronic equipment  possibly start fires  and in  some situations electrocute you  ie  some us jurisdictions  require the stove frame connected to neutral     if this happens  contact your electrical authority immediately  and have them come and check out the problem    note  a brief      second  brightening is sometimes normal with  lighting and motors on the same    v with neutral circuit   a  loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness  far longer than one second   in case of doubt  get help   subject  what is   phase power   should i use it   can i get it in my house    three phase power has three  hot  wires      degrees out of  phase with each other   these are usually used for large motors  because it is more  efficient   provides a bit more starting torque   and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper    you re most likely to encounter a   phase circuit that shows      volts between any hot and ground  and     volts between  any two hots   the latter shows the difference between a normal     v    v common neutral circuit  which is     volts between the  two hots   there are   phase circuits with different voltages    bringing in a   phase feed to your house is usually  ridiculously expensive  or impossible   if the equipment you  want to run has a standard motor mount  it is  much  cheaper to  buy a new    v or    v motor for it   in some cases it is  possible to run   phase equipment on ordinary power if you have  a  capacitor start  unit  or use a larger motor as a   auto  generator   these are tricky  but are a good solution if  the motor is non standard size  or too expensive or too big to  replace   the taunton press book   the small shop   has an  article on how to do this if you must    note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using  such a converter   the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that   subject  is it better to run motors at     or        theoretically  it doesn t make any difference   however  there  is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply  wiring   all things being equal  a    v motor will lose   times  less power in the house wiring than a    v motor   this also  means that the startup surge loss will be less  and the motor  will get to speed quicker   and in some circumstances  the  smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life    this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more  than    feet long   subject  what is this nonsense about  hp on    v   a circuits    it is a universal physical law that   hp is equal to      watts   given heating loss  power factor and other inefficiencies   it is usually best to consider   hp is going to need            watts   a    v   a circuit can only deliver      watts to a motor   so it cannot possibly be more than approximately   hp   given rational  efficiency factors     hp is more like it    some equipment manufacturers  sears in particular  most router  manufacturers in general     advertise a hp rating that is far  in excess of what is possible   they are giving you a  stall  horsepower  or similar   that means the power is measured when  the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load   what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that  condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker  will trip  otherwise the motor will melt    it s drawing far  more current than it can continuously    when comparing motors  compare the continuous horsepower   this  should be on the motor nameplate   if you can t find that figure   check the amperage rating  which is always present   subject  how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong    older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead  of the more modern three   these receptacles have no safety  ground  and the cabling usually has no ground wire   neither  the nec or cec permits installing new   prong receptacles anymore    there are several different approaches to solving this          if the wiring is done through conduit or bx  and the         conduit is continuous back to the panel  you can connect         the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle         box   nec mainly   cec frowns on this practise          if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby  and         it s continuous to the main house ground point  you can         run a conductor to it from the third prong          run a ground conductor back to the main panel          easiest  install a gfci receptacle   the ground lug         should not be connected to anything  but the gfci         protection itself will serve instead   the gfci         will also protect downstream  possibly also two prong         outlets    if you do this to protect downstream outlets          the grounds must not be connected together   since it         wouldn t be connected to a real ground  a wiring fault         could energize the cases of   prong devices connected         to other outlets   be sure  though  that there aren t         indirect ground plug connections  such as via the sheath         on bx cable    the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three  prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop   like caulking compound   this is not permitted in the nec   subject  are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets   should the test button work    we re sure about what the nec and cec say   remember  though   that your local codes may vary   as for the test button    there s  a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line  side of the neutral wire when you press the test button   current  through this resistor shows up as an imbalance  and trips the gfci   this is a simple  passive  and reliable test  and doesn t require  a real ground to work   if your gfci does not trip when you press  the test button  it is very probably defective or miswired   again   if the test button doesn t work  something s broken  and potentially  dangerous   the problem should be corrected immediately    the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground  wire must be connected   we do not know why they say this   the  causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet  or with the  formalities of ul or csa listing    perhaps the device was never  tested without the ground wire being connected   on the other hand   ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device  behaves properly in  all  listed applications  including ungrounded  outlet replacement    one of us called leviton  their gfcis are  labeled for installation on grounded circuits only   the technician  was surprised to see that  he agreed that the nec does not require  it  and promised to investigate    subject  how should i wire my shop    as with any other kind of wiring  you need enough power for all  devices that will be on simultaneously   the code specifies  that you should stay under     of the nominal capacity of the  circuit   for typical home shop use  this means one circuit for  the major power tools  and possibly one for a dust collector or  shop vac   use at least    gauge wire    many power tools have  big motors  with a big start up surge   if you can  use    amp  breakers  nec   though cec requires standard   a receptacles  which means you d have to  replug  all your equipment   lights  should either be on a circuit of their own    and not shared  with circuits in the rest of the house    or be on at least two  separate circuits   the idea is that you want to avoid a  situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand  rpm  while you re groping in the dark for the off switch    do install lots of outlets   it s easier to install them in the  beginning  when you don t have to cut into an existing cable   it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each  point  so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same  time as the tool you really want   but use metal boxes and  plates  and maybe even metal sheathed cable  you may have  objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit  wrong    note that some jurisdictions have a  no horizontal wiring   rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used  for working   what this means is that all wiring must be  run along structural members   ie  stapled to studs    other possible shop circuits include heater circuits     v  circuits for some large tools  and air compressor circuits   don t overload circuits  and don t use extension cords if you  can help it  unless they re rated for high currents    a coiled  extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of  the same gauge   also  the insulation won t withstand as much  heat  and heat dissipation is the critical issue     if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel   you should probably install a subpanel  and derive your shop  wiring from it   if you have young children  you may want to  equip this panel with a cut off switch  and possibly a lock   if you want to install individual switches to   safe    particular circuits  make sure you get ones rated high enough   for example  ordinary light switches are not safely able to  handle the start up surge generated by a table saw   buy    horsepower rated   switches instead    finally  note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished  basements  hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply   and  even if you   know   that you d never use one of your shop  outlets to run a lawn mower  the next owner of your house might  have a different idea    note  fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop  wiring   april      is one place to start   subject  underground wiring   you will need to prepare a trench to specifications  use  special wire  protect the wire with conduit or special plastic  tubing and possibly lumber  don t use creosoted lumber  it rots  thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion  of lead    the transition from in house to underground wire is  generally via conduit   all outdoor boxes must be specifically  listed for the purpose  and contain the appropriate gaskets   fittings  etc   if the location of the box is subject to immersion  in water  a more serious style of water proof box is needed   and  of course  don t forget the gfcis    the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction  so we suggest you consult your inspector about  your specific situation    a hint  buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says  buried power  line  and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed   subject  aluminum wiring   during the      s  aluminum  instead of copper  wiring became  quite popular and was extensively used   since that time   aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires   and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations   we recommend  even if you re allowed to  that do not use it for new  wiring    but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring   aluminum  wiring  when properly installed  can be just as safe as copper   aluminum wiring is  however  very unforgiving of improper  installation   we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential  problems  and what you can do to make your wiring safe    the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as   cold creep    when aluminum wiring warms up  it expands   when  it cools down  it contracts   unlike copper  when aluminum goes  through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each  time   to make the problem worse  aluminum oxidises  or corrodes  when in contact with certain types of metal  so the resistance  of the connection goes up   which causes it to heat up and corrode   oxidize still more   eventually the wire may start getting very hot   melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to  and possibly even  cause a fire    since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move  into a house built during the    s  we will cover basic points of  safe aluminum wiring   we suggest that  if you re considering purchasing  a home with aluminum wiring  or have discovered it later  that you  hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring  for the following things           fixtures  eg  outlets and switches  directly attached to         aluminum wiring should be rated for it   the device will         be stamped with  al cu  or  co alr    the latter supersedes         the former  but both are safe    these fixtures are somewhat         more expensive than the ordinary ones           wires should be properly connected  at least     way around         the screw in a clockwise direction    connections should be         tight   while repeated tightening of the screws can make the         problem worse  during the inspection it would pay off to snug         up each connection           note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the         main service entrance cable   it should be inspected            push in  terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire          any connections using push in terminals should be redone with         the proper screw connections immediately           there should be no signs of overheating  darkened connections          melted insulation  or  baked  fixtures   any such damage should         be repaired                connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be         handled specially   current canadian codes require that the         wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting         aluminum to copper   the nec requires that the wire be         connected together using special crimp devices  with an         anti oxidant grease   the tools and materials for the latter         are quite expensive   not practical to do it yourself unless         you can rent the tool           any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring         by means of a short copper  pigtail    see     above                shows reasonable workmanship  neat wiring  properly stripped          not nicked  wire etc        if  when considering purchasing a home  an inspection of the wiring  shows no problems or only one or two  we believe that you can

it s generally a good idea to hire  an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas   not just for wiring  but plumbing and structural as well   if an  inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor  ones  we believe that you can consider the wiring safe  after any  minor problems are fixed    if there are signs of problems in many  places  we suggest you look elsewhere    here s some hints on what to look for    obvious non code wiring can include       zip cord wiring  either concealed or nailed to walls     hot wiring on the identified  neutral

unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines   certain wiring practises that are actually to code  or were at one  time  sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations       switches

except when     it s  really  convenient         switches and outlets in bizarre locations     great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps     junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them     wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or     ceiling     backwrapped grounding wires  subject  what is this weird stuff   old style wiring    in the years since edison  invented  electricity  several different  wiring  styles  have come and gone   when you buy an older home you  may encounter some of this stuff   this section describes the old   methods  and some of their idiosyncrasies    the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called   knob and tube   k t    it is made up of individual conductors with  a cloth insulation   the wires are run along side structural  members  eg  joists or studs  using ceramic stand offs  knobs    wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes   connections  were made by twisting the wire together  soldering  and wrapping  with tape   since the hot and neutral were run separately   the wiring tends to be rather confusing   a neutral often runs  down the centre of each room  with  taps  off to each fixture   the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next   in some  cases k t isn t colour coded  so the neutral is often the same  colour as the hot wires    you ll see k t in homes built as late as the    s    comments on k t       the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about     electricity  so the workmanship tends to be pretty good      the wire  insulation and insulators tend to stand up     very well   most k t i ve seen  for example  is in     quite good condition      no grounding   grounding is usually difficult to install      boxes are small   receptacle replacement  particularly with     gfci  can be difficult   no bushing on boxes either      so wiring changes need special attention to box entry      sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between     separately hot circuits  so it is sometimes possible to     overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on     any circuit      building code does not permit insulation in walls     that contain k t      connection to existing k t from new circuits can be     tricky   consult your inspector      modern wiring practise requires considerably more     outlets to be installed than k t systems did     since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t  necessary to replace it simply because it s k t   what you should  watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and  be cautious about circuit loading   in many cases it s perfectly  reasonable to leave existing k t alone  and add new fixtures on  new circuits using modern techniques     after k t  they invented multi conductor cable   the first type  you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation   it looks  much like the romex cable of the last decade or two   this stuff was  used in the    s and    s   again  no grounding conductor   it was installed much like modern wiring   its major drawback  is that this type of insulation embrittles   we ve seen whole  systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at  a touch   bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems    this stuff is very fragile  and becomes rather hazardous if  the wires become bare   this wiring should be left untouched as  much as possible   whenever an opportunity arises  replace it   a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several  hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink  tubing    after this wiring technique  the more modern romex was invented   it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth   often a bit sticky   this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard  and is reasonably easy to work with   it does not need to be  replaced   it should be considered as safe as the  modern  stuff    thermoplastic insulation wire   just don t abuse it too much   subject  where do i buy stuff    try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you   their  prices will often be considerably better

amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing  if you open the amp up  there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well   perfect   symmetry for both channels and two transformers   one for each   channel   the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the classe model    ie  very good   i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east   or where ever   but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed  you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant  i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with   those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly   hot   but that s how you get an

wrong   anyone else think so   back in the    s i was a service technician for a cash register company  the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise   the biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded   in almost every place we went to do an installation  we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral   for       of the things you can plug into one of these  they work fine   for our cash registers they were a nightmare    line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically   with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem   even the company i used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment   i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected   although not ideal  it should be o k  for most applications

direction    to further explain the situation  assume we are firing sonars a b c   ms apart each other  we should normally see an echo on a that corresponds to the distance  however  sonar a detects the init line of sonar b  the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a  we can see a very faint   khz signal on the transducer  exactly at the time the init line of sonar b is activated    we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference  we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars b and c    has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and this type of experience  your suggestions for remedies will be greatly appreciated        caglan m  aras                    aras eceris ece ncsu edu ece

section  could also be used at these speeds   there is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this  the mc      if i remember rightly      while using this would have let me reduce the  external  if count on receive  it didn t really offer all that much help on transmit so i didn t bother with it     the radios i built were first designed and built for     kbps in a   mhz channel but later reduced to half that   these     kbps radios actually have done quite well in across the bench tests at     kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design   handling the data stream

is a phd research project and i have to test  the chip at speed on a pcb  i expect to have roughly      packaged circuits and will do dc  low speed and high speed  testing using   different set ups for the test chip        i know for sure that a dip will not work   the long lead lines have too high an inductance    getting a custom made package is too expensive  so  i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a  leadless chip carrier  the flatpack would be hard  to test since it has to be soldered on to the test  setup and i would spend loads of time soldering   as i kept changing the test chip  the leadless chip  carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may  not work at high speeds       does anyone out there have experience knowledge  of this field   i would greatly appreciate

and we use dip s along with plcc s    mil and   mil pitch    pin qfp s to name a few   i don t see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices     a good source of information is motorola s mecl system design handbook  the latest ed  is dated        that is considered to be one of the  bibles  in high speed design   the very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you re most likely going to need a socket   it in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing  not to mention any impedance discontinuities   i don t see the big concern over the packaging because it probably isn t going to make that much difference  if you re trying to get ttl to run at    mhz  have fun    ttl was never designed to run in a    mhz

in the far east    or where ever   but if you look in the amp and see what components    they use and how it was designed  you can easily see why the    amplifiers sound so brilliant   good point   also  i wouldn t be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior quality   as long as it was properly designed and robust  premium components are used  it shouldn t matter where it is assembled    i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with    those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly    hot   but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good   an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound  the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day   actually  i d be wary of excessively hot amps   cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way  excessive  heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component regardless of quality   in fact  an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs   hmmmmm      aaron     newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from

signal of the radio tape unit is before it   gets amplified  because then couldn t i hook up rca outputs to that signal   so then he could just use a little amplifier    well  one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips   use a probe with a   m resistor  like a scope probe  connected to the input of a small audio amp w speaker   if you find line level input to both chips  one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily     if you want to pick off a near line level signal  suitable for feeding to an outboard amp  the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough   this is  before  the volume control  and usually before the tone and balance controls too    if you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot  this will be after the volume control  but again  probably  before the other controls      if the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip  you should probably forget the whole

massive concrete cylinders that  are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders  that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the  actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called   cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool   except for their size  the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the      s  a hundred years ago  for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways   basicly  the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower     of the tower  to assist cooling and the draft  water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes  the cold water evaporates  removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft  this produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers   that slight pinch  maybe     of the way up the tower  is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced  compared to a straight cylinder shape   the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again  the wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference  sometimes as high as      degrees or more from first stage  hot  turbine to final stage  cold  turbine

wrote     i really don t know where to post this question so i figured that    this board would be most appropriate     i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that    are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders    that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the    actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called     cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool        except for their size  the cooling towers on nuclear power plants   are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling   towers designed and built in the      s  a hundred years ago  for   coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways        basicly  the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when   its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network   of pipes that fill about the lower     of the tower  to assist cooling   and the draft  water misters are added that spray cold water over the   hot pipes  the cold water evaporates  removing the heat faster than   just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is   rapidly carried away by the draft  this produces the clouds frequently   seen rising out of these towers        that slight pinch  maybe     of the way up the tower  is there because   it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of   the air draft produced  compared to a straight cylinder shape        the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam   system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the   boiler and used again  the wider the temperature difference across   the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and   by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it   back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference    sometimes as high as      degrees or more from first stage  hot    turbine to final stage  cold  turbine

grounding power wiring  was re  a question about    vac outlet wiring  there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here   a few points need to be clarified   the equipment grounding conductor  green  green with a yellow stripe  bare  or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods  is used as a safety ground  to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel  and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects   it should never  except for a few exceptions to be discussed later  carry the normal operating current of a connected load   some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor     much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor  and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation    orange  outlets are often used for this  with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box  and in many cases back to the service   anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems   the code requires the insulated grounding conductors  green wires  to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box  and  if required  back all the way to the service entrance   where it is bonded to the service ground  water pipe or rod   many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely  where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either    the grounded conductor of a circuit  often called the neutral  which is referred to in the code as the  identified  conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey   this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point  generally at the service entrance panel   this connection is through the main bonding jumper    in many household service panels  the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel     the grounded conductor  neutral  is generally a current carrying conductor   in the case of a     volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device     since the grounded conductor  neutral  is only connected to the grounding conductor  bare or green  at the service entrance  if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current  there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load  under normal operating conditions   if you should  incorrectly  connect the grounded  neutral  conductor to the grounding conductor at the load  some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor   since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor  it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end   if the load equipment has a metal case  which is connected to the grounding conductor through the  u  ground plug  the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential   the difference  under normal  non short circuit conditions  may be only a few tenths of a volt  but it could also be a volt or two   this normally does not present a shock hazard     however  if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe  a radiator  a metal air conditioning duct or such  part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path   if the contact is not solid  you will get a significant arc  a low voltage  but possibly moderate current arc  under the wrong conditions  this arcing could start a fire   it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size  causing it to overheat   with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral  if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral  the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor  which increases the possibility for shock or fire     also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground  the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment  often causing malfunction   i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment   the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling   this is done primarily for lightning protection  so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground  and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly   the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer   some of it flows through the grounding electrode  water pipe  etc   this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks  and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the  hot  conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground   there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy    don t flame me on this  i m just telling you where the field comes from  not it s health effect  as far as i m concerned  the jury is still out on this    note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel  not at any sub distribution panels   this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel  you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral   the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor   if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel  say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw  all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground  with the possible problems listed above   the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers  as well as feeds from one building to another   in the cases of the range and dryer  the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions  instead of a seperate wire   every time the code is revised  these exceptions come up for review   these exceptions were  in fact the first required safety grounds  in the days before u ground outlets and such   the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers  and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable  with four fairly heavy  expensive wires  in place of three wire to the appliances   no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove  but the neutral current is low for most burner settings  since most current is in the     volt  hots  except at some low settings  the wires are large gauge  and there are few reported cases of injury or damage   so far  the exceptions have survived  in the case of feeds between buildings  it s primarily for lightning protection   people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor   obviously  the bare wire in  romex   with ground  is   anywhere there is a green wire installed  such as in a portable cord  that is a good grounding conductor   the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor  in the us    bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath   you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends  you don t have to bond it to anything  it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath   conduit or emt  thinwall tubing  is generally a legal grounding conductor  but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel  particularly for larger pipes      greenfield   looks like big bx  but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it  is not a legal grounding conductor  as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it  and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance   you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield    wiremold  is also not a legal grounding conductor  as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact  and the  feed  to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box   i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were  hot  with     volts  why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office   because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box   you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring  conduit  bx  etc   where you can  bond  the wire to the box with a screw  bnding clip  or whatever   on another issue  while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them  it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available   it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it   the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip   it is desirable to connect the ground if available  because if the ground is connected  the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in  whereas without the ground  it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path   for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s  read in the nec         d

this board would be most appropriate      i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that     are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders     that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the     actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called      cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool   great explaination  however you left off one detail  why do you always  see them at nuclear plants  but not always at fossil fuel plants   at  nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle  whereas  fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot  water   as i recall the water isn t as hot  thermodynamically  in many  fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive  contamination          actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling water reactor nuclear plants    there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses      vintage steam technology    so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible   hence big cooling towers            oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers  but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water  not most of the way down to ambient   some plants do cool the condensers with water  rather than air  as one canadian official  asked about  thermal  pollution  de icing a river  said   up here  we view heat as a resource             everybody runs closed cycle boilers   the water used is  purified of solids  which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils   purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it  so the boiler water is recycled        john nagle  newsgroup  sci electronics document id

fast   very forgiving and easy to work with  beware static electricity   but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too    there are neat devices in this family that exist in no

it should be noted that the hourglass shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants   it should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful  the cooling towers are only used part time  when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit  it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish  fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect

fiddled    with the tuning  tracking and vertical hold but it was no good       it sounds like your tv is one of the ones that also reacts to the video  protection    poor you    the macroscrubber from radio electronics removes the protection so you  souldn t have any more problems   however  if you use the method of  copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr doesn t react to  the protection  you will end up with a duplicate tape  including the  protection   one thought comes to mind about your problem     when playing the tape  for viewing  are you feeding the signal from the source vcr through an  extra device before going to the tv   if you feed it through a second vcr  first  that is your problem   as to other devices such as converters  i  don t know if they would react or not   just to be safe  you might want  to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv   victor inqmind bison mb ca the inquiring mind bbs  winnipeg  manitoba

c l x  kj  vcd hp com   john eaton writes             during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough  to melt  when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling  tower where it is sprayed into the air  contact with the cool outside air  will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor   there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then  reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day     cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be  power companies  are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the  raw uranium emisions to be held to under     this law is now under attack  by lawyers arguing that the    should be measured at the edge of the property  rather than the edge of the cooling tower  eliminating this law will save  power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes     john eaton   hp vcd johne    i think you posted your article    days too late      april  st is over  i don t like nuclear powerplants but i think it s not fair to tell such  storys  about them  ok   let me try to explain what that tower is used to       st  even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam engine           it has an hightech  boiler  but the rest is still verry verry           conventional  and if you ve already visited any condensation           powerstation you l have seen the cooling towers too           if you look at any good book about thermophysics you ll find          a chapter about the  carnot process  which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference   and that is the reason          for cooling towers too     you only can get energy if you ve an          temperature gradient  that means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam  till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox      of the           energy you  or better the uranium  brought into the water to          let it boil  if you only have hot steam on the one and  cold           steam on the other side you ll loose much more of the energy           and so they cool down the steam to get at least the     of          energy that carnot will give them           the cooling towers are for cooling the steam            the vapor you ll see is not the steam of the main core circulation           because that steam is radioactive   the circulation is divided in          at least   circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment                  nd  ok  the main core is hot  but even in the modernst hightemperature           reactors  htr  they only run at      deg celsius  this is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around      deg  celsius   but you ll have lot s of problems with          the boiler s steel  that s because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast           this is only for bwr s  the new he cooled reactors have temperatures          up to      deg  celsius  but this is only experimental         rd  i personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years  today   mrem and next year     mrem won t be      mrem          at all  it accumulates and even in    years you ll still have              mrem  and i m not interested in glowing in the night and

john de armond  subject  re  what do nuclear site s cooling towers do   nagle netcom com  john nagle  writes     great explaination  however you left off one detail  why do you always   see them at nuclear plants  but not always at fossil fuel plants   at   nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle  whereas   fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot   water   as i recall the water isn t as hot  thermodynamically  in many   fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive   contamination   actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are    fossil units  multiple units per plant  are generally smaller than nuclear plants       mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built   the average nuclear plant is      mwe      many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted   why those old dirt burners can t harm anything  let  em go          powered draft cooling towers  low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site  are quite popular with fossil plants      fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears           actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual   boiling water reactor nuclear plants    there s a gripe in the industry  that nuclear power uses      vintage steam technology    so it s  more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system  as cold as possible   hence big cooling towers             oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers  but they  usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water  not most of the  way down to ambient   some plants do cool the condensers with water   rather than air  as one canadian official  asked about  thermal   pollution  de icing a river  said   up here  we view heat as a resource      actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size   the issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from   condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine   the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature   it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes   the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best     a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell  where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes    since the condenser is at a very low pressure  the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity   if the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low  the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate   this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs     the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps   how much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell   typically hotwell temperatures run between     and      degrees depending on the temperature of the river water  this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped    when the river water temperature is high in the summer  operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head   there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area   at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air      the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers   the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity   it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding    degrees   a vast difference from the typical         days     degrees      humidity  we see routinely in the east  it is not unusual  particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant  for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure           everybody runs closed cycle boilers   the water used is   purified of solids  which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when  the water boils   purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than   cooling it  so the boiler water is recycled   true   actually secondary plant  the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler  water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves  the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water   by  impure   i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen   secondary water is now typically the most

as it was   properly designed and robust  premium components are used  it   shouldn t matter where it is assembled   definately  i agree wholeheartedly   if they can build the amp where   the labour is not so expensive  they can afford to put decent   components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the   amplifier   as adcom has done      i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with      those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly      hot   but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good     an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound    the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day     actually  i d be wary of excessively hot amps   cauz even though   the components inside may be rated to run that way  excessive    heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component   regardless of quality   in fact  an amp that does run hot to the touch is   because either the engineer or

those zebra connectors and fail to operate     now we buy flukes  the low end    series mostly   and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone      what the world needs is a meter that won t let you change ranges or turn it on off with a lead stuck in the amps jack   a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans  anyway     not that i ve

that the new gps boxes now have an option  known as  differential ready    apparently land based  beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps   receiver  with differential option installed     how does this system work   what frequency is used for  the land based beacons    thanks in advance    charlie thompson     here s a rough sketch of how the system works   a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals   these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion  sa  selective availability  time dithering  etc   the reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to  back out  the errors in its position  since it knows where it is already    it then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers   if the receivers are nearby      km  and are using the same satellites as the reference unit  the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit   thus  the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit   the us coast guard is currently  as far as i know  installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps   these stations will use existing radio towers   i believe the frequency is to be approximately     khz   there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies   for example  pinpoint                  offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us   the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm     format  advertised accuracies espouse   to   meter errors

deflection coil of other monitors to be specific  have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem  this sounds like your problem since flourescent lites  motors  etc several   s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it  but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor  fusebox on other side of wall maybe  we started spec ing panasonic ct     y video monitors    switchable input lines vid   aud  s vhs on one         this stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it   now on to your problem  you need what is known as mu shielding  very common  in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type o scopes   i talked to a ee prof  he said get a coffee can  cut both ends off  mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor   be careful to avoid all high voltage circuitry  especially the thicker high voltage anode lead usually colored red  if you kill yourself  don t blame sue me    use plastic or other non conducting stand offs and such to mount can  now  i would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out  so hopefully this ll work by mounting shield on

is the particular chip dead  it is a pull  not new    moreover  the place i bought it from is sending me an xc     rc     i thought  that the      rc   were labeled mc not xc  for not finalized mask

level noise   i have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that i am using  analogic       has some relatively large common mode noise on it   i am using this synthesizer to  null  out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference      uv  several hundred  times   the      has about     mvp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat    the noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency  and on a spectrum analyzer  the main component is about   hz    how can i get rid of the noise   when i look at the spectrum using an hp     a  audio range analyzer   the noise goes away the minute i switch to   isolation  on the input   i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to dc   also  if i use a differential amplifier  ia  to solve the problem   how important is it to use one of these  shield drivers   an amp connected  to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused  by different cable capacitances    if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for  use with transient signals with content from  khz to about    khz  i would appreciate it     newsgroup  sci electronics

i m sorry if somebody already mentioned   this  but you could grab a lemon  i think potatoes work too  but i m not   sure   a strip of copper  and a strip of zinc  i think you can get the   metal in a hardware store or hobby shop  maybe      stick the strips in   the lemon  so they don t touch   and you ll get a measurable voltage  not   a lot  but  hey  it s a lemon          as i recall we had to hook   something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of   current  because of the mondo internal resistance  but if you just need a   demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or

would this be a correct presumption   what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects     the affected equipment is about     feet from the road     hams can legally run up to      watts   it is very unlikely  however  that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car   ham rigs for cars put out around     watts   it is possible that a     watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic     feet  away   most tvs  stereos  and vcrs have very poor rf shielding  if you experience the problem frequently  it may be  caused by a ham  cber  or other radio operator in a base station nearby     the interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes  such as police  fire  etc   if you heard voices over your stereo  i think you are correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter   if you have frequent trouble  you may want to try the rf ferrite chokes available at radio shack   the interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires  and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily  without cutting them   good instructions are included with the chokes  if that does not solve the problem  you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator   look for antennas on the roof or car   talk to him her about your problem   there are things a radio operator can do to reduce

automation a bit  namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up   our current automation consoles date from the early    s and don t provide this function   we already have the combo failsafe contact rollers to read the cuetapes  and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade up control circuit      vac  is momentarily closed  for at least     second   i ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a   v relay  activated when the cue tape completes the circuit   low tech and simple  but there s one problem   in order to get the     second pulse  there needs to be a sh  load of cuetape on the film      mm runs at    feet per minute  so to get a     second pulse  there needs to be at least   inches of solid cuetape    ideally  i would like to use a single cross cue to accomplish this function   a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film  this would give a pulse of approximately       of a second  what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around     second   the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice   i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort   i m sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads   any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated    thanks   mark fontana        of all the arts  the cinema is     mark a

to build a circuit that detects the presence of video  vs  a blank screen  by monitoring the r g  and b outputs of a graphics card   it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at    mhz  which would mean detecting a    ns pulse   it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen  about     mv  and a dim screen  say  around     mv    oh yes  it also needs to be cheap     my first circuit was a dismal failure   i used   compariators  each compariator had the   input going to one of the guns  the   input went to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer    the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow   i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators  so i could have a whole screen full of text  but my circuit would not detect it      the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen   in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only     mv   i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work     there are faster compariators  but they are expensive  and require  split supplies    i would need to replace my     quad compariator with three      compariators  and create a whole new power supply circuit     at this point  i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit   transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick     unfortunately  i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits  so i am appealing to the net for help   any ideas  tips  circuits  pointers  references  etc  would be greatly appreciated     oh yes  i only sample the output of this thing every second or so  so i don

is about     feet from the road     hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp   and are also unlikely to have a  dirty  amp      hams can legally run up to      watts   it is very unlikely  however     that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car   ham rigs  not possible either   you d need about a     amp alternator for just the amplifier   i can just see it   you need to slow down on

most tvs  stereos  and vcrs have very poor rf shielding     if you experience the problem frequently  it may be     caused by a ham  cber  or other radio operator in a base station    nearby     the interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes  such as police  fire     etc   if you heard voices over your stereo  i think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter      if you have frequent trouble  you may want to try the rf ferrite    chokes available at radio shack   the interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires  and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily  without cutting them      good instructions are included with the chokes     if that does not solve the problem  you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator   look for antennas on the roof    or car   talk to him her about your problem   there are things    a radio operator can do to reduce

information that you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of  human body landmarks  eg  the selspot system by selspot ab  sweden  and the watsmart system       these use lateral photoeffect detectors  lindholm and oberg        woltring and marsolais        to determine the position of a spot of light projected  using a camera lens  over its surface   in escence  the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes  one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal  and a single anode  the back of the crystal    a spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector s face   let s try some ascii graphics in   d  so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position

by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina  tion  the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power    when this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light  then the way of  tuning  to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal  light the led for an equal time and sample that signal separately   the difference between the two is the position of

design   i will  however  point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected   remember that any interference is wasted power  if i put out  w in the tv band  that s  w that i am not putting out in the band i am trying to transmit on  and  w can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall  and nothing   cbers  however  are usually not as helpful   most illegal cbers  however  will stop operation when you inform them of a problem   the rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local fcc office of the problem  in writing  and giving details and addresses     last  you can usually tell ham radio vs  cb   ham operators are  required to declare their call  sign  every so many minutes  no more  than       so if you hear  this is wa qt  or some other call starting  with a  w or k and no more than   total characters  you heard a ham   cb ers probably won t sign  i don t know that they re even required  to  and fire police have other private ids   good advice   hams will frequently give their call  and will never use a  handle    they are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well  but that s not

work        hello       let me introduce a problem      when i measure a sinusoidal wave  voltage  with a digital voltmeter  using  ac mode  my output is an rms value  a peak value over   squared     right        when i measure a square wave in the same mode  ac   my output is equal  to a peak value  actually  to the upper flat boundary of the wave     i assumed  that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the  input value  and divides it over the wave period    right      now  i used it to measure the same  square wave as above  but distorted  by high frequency harmonics  ideally  output should be the same  but    the output value was only about     of the previous one      why  what is the nature of this output value  what does the voltmeter  actually measure  and

it is  nearly uv     i m sure you can figure out now just what  far uv  is    regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum  such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source   stronger sources are going to require gas  probably mercury vapor  discharge tubes  such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor    be careful  though  strong uv sources can cause physiological damage  especially to the eyes   the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous   it wouldn t project a beam like a flashlight  but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source   it would be bright enough to be useful  but not dangerously so      ed hall

commercial ssi implementations allow you to use one as such  strictly  a   of   decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state  according to the inputs   a demux  on the other hand  uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal  so there are three inputs required   a decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input  since this can be used as the data input  e g  when high  all outputs are high  when low  only the selected  by control inputs  output will be low    an eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit  bit    to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled  thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits  note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux  since you have no data input  the enable line on a four way decoder  left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose   a sixteen way decoder obviously requires four  four way decoders  plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time  therefore  use the fifth decoder  attached to the two high order bits  to provide the four enable lines   of course  the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders   please give me the credit when you submit your homework   johnh

bc d    acd    abc    ab c    the books on logic design i have consulted all seem to imply that this  is where the analysis ends       but by factoring out the   a  term in the function  we can get fewer gates    f a b c d    bc d    a cd    bc    b c     which yields   gates     yes  but    the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations   a ttl gate has the basic structure of and or invert  and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay   the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization    a positive or gate  such as the   gate solution uses  has two gate delays  and there s another gate delay in the second term  so that the second solution  while simpler in logic symbols  can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world  ecl is similar to ttl  in that it can support an or and gate with the minimum delay  unlike ttl  you get both true and inverse outputs for  free  when using ecl     pals are basically large programmable and or invert gates  with your choice of internal connections between the various sections  and perhaps some latches   so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few pals   it s not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates  but some software packages claim to allow you to do so  and will take just about any mess of gates  as a nodelist with   xxx series logic ics  and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job   xilinx s xact software does this by treating

experience with it the       unfortunately i want to switch an  ac signal which goes from about   v to  v  and the      is only  for positive signals           i have a carrier signal which varies

 hmmm   how are those orange  isolated ground  outlets  often used in  computer rooms  wired     they require two separate grounds   one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet  and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet s mounting tabs  and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate  if any    the box faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground  the outlet ground pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is  in turn  connected to the building entrance main ground by its own wire   so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building s service entrance   but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building  while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated ground outlets of that panel   if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a    v feeder to ground  the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows  while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise free   newsgroup  sci electronics document id

better fidelity  wouldn t i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process   furthermore  am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate  from the player s point of view  as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium   does this mean that the data rate  related to the rotational speed of the disk  has  changed since        i m

neutral return wires when things in the house are operating   there should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition   notice also that in the breaker box there is a wire

from  kolstad cae wisc edu  joel kolstad  subject  re   x oversampling cd player  in article  hcbc un l dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes     hello      i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that  it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think  i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples   exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor    i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when  i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs  said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting  senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take  samples at a higher rate   if i really wanted better fidelity  wouldn t  i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording  process   furthermore  am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate   from the player s point of view  as being the same thing as the data  rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium   does this mean  that the data rate  related to the rotational speed of the disk  has   changed since         note  i just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself  from various people on the net  so i could be wrong    the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course   and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data  oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more complicated   anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective  sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias filtering           joel kolstad  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  galen picea cfnr colostate edu  galen watts  subject  re  suggestions  on audio relays

there are bubblejets  and then there are bubblejets   there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output   such as hp s dinky little bubblejet   whereas most produce really good  looking output  such as hp s deskjets    ibm and canon both produce some of  the really good style bubblejets    p s     if you re in the market for a portable bubblejet printer  i can  highly recommend the hp portable deskjet  although i ve heard the portable  canons are good too  i needed pcl support  myself    with the deskjet  portable  you even get an undocumented pcmcia card slot   i second that suggestion   although i don t own the hp portable deskjet  i  do  own the hp deskjet       it gives the nicest outputs  with only a minor loss of quality    for all intensive purposes  papers  letters  resumes   i treat my deskjet like a laser printer  you  do  have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters    only one grudge  the ink that hp gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture  even though the ink is waterproof    however  you would have to spend about      more for laser quality   the cannon bubblejets are nice  however they don t seem to have as much support  eg  drivers for popular programs  as the hp ink jets  also hp deskjet  regular plus        c  accepts xerox paper  i believe that the cut sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet    if you don t mind refilling your printer with cheap ink  say fountain pen ink   then the hp deskjets are  very  cheap to maintain  i paid       for my last bottle of ink and i

setting    put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven   set oven to     degrees  the lowest setting on my oven   if yours goes down to     that s probably even better    stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch   this allows for airflow   leave the stuff in the oven for   to   hours

piped into a command center they re building somewhere in the east bay   i m not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data  but large multi colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway   an announcer will sit in front of the status  wall   and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it   they re apparently also looking into licensing a low am frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system   in the mean time  they ll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead   my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program  and information from it will be available free of charge   perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate  read  cheap     we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels   and      these are verbal reports  qualified with a identification tone to tell in vehicle receivers like the  auto talk  that the information coming next is applicable to a given area   in la  they re probably using some other tv channels  but the concept is the same   try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel  and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information  i believe this program is also subsidized  making the in vehicle receivers cheap to purchase  and without having to incur monthly fees to use it    since the makers of these in vehicle receivers don t have to pay for the broadcast  this may not be completely true   they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves   you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car  nothing more  when this happens   perhaps a word to the

adjustable from     v current     limited  at  a  voltage must stay within    of designated value for i from    a ac ripple less than   mv  rms   of course  we can t just use an adjustable voltage  current limiting regulator chip      our problem is with the current limiting  i e  we ve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit    what the supply must do  if presented with a load which would draw more than  a  given the supply voltage  is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp   thus  if we were to short the thing with the ammeter  we should read one amp   if we measure the current through a   ohm  resistor at   v  we should read one amp  and the output voltage  by necessity  must be  v   the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor  and therefore reduce the output   so  does anybody have any ideas we could work from   thanks in advance   andy

guts on straight dc instead of an inverter    why not do it all the time   then there d be no switchover to screw   things up  and no having to sense the failure fast   just keep the dc   on charge when the power is on  and it ll be there in zero time when   you  need  it       actually  it s a bit more complicated than that   i sounds to me   your ups takes in ac  rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries  and  then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again  feeding your  equipment   this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to  switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since   as you mentioned  nothing will know about what happened down the line    another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you  lose power  and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to  replace the lost power   the problem here is the switchover time and  you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat  that s a standby unit not a ups  otherwise there would be no interuption  many standby units are labled as ups s though        morgan bullard mb     coewl cen uiuc edu        or  mjbb uxa cso uiuc edu    unfortunately  most everything is built around the

article  kolstad cae wisc edu  joel kolstad  writes   in article  hcbc un l dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes       i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that   it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think   i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples    exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor     i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when   i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs   said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting   senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take   samples at a higher rate      the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course    and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data   oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points  between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the  interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more  complicated   you are quite correct in your understanding   the filtering is not interpolation  as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to   generally  these players run the samples thru an all pass filter network   i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s heart  and the effect is rather spooky   it actually reconstructs peaks that weren t there  correctly  too   and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values  just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point   i use a cpu to do all the math   it takes a decent  but not unreasonable  amount of cpu time to do this   you can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code   in case you care  the filtering method uses an fir  finite impulse response  filter   i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method   anybody out there know the real answer   i d say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering   this strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs     anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective   sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency  antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling  lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher  oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of  all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should  allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias  filtering   actually  i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic   i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not   you can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp    it s too bad that they charge more for something that  i think  is actually less costly to build   i seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better   they are built to a price spec  and that spec says  cheap as possible                joel kolstad     dave     dave mcmahan                            mcmahan netcom com

pink noise  tony wayne writes    what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments    tony  pink noise is a random signal with more low frequency components than white noise   if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer  you will find that the spectrum power density is flat  which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal   often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low pass filtering a white noise signal  therefore pink noise contains much more low frequency components   the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals  an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why   enjoy it   wouter   newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  cmh eng

dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes         i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that    it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think    i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples     exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor      i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when    i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs    said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting    senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take    samples at a higher rate       the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course     and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data    oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points   between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the   interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more   complicated    you are quite correct in your understanding   the filtering is not  interpolation  as that would distort the frequency content of the signal  they do interpolate   it s not linear interpolation though  you are correct that the frequency content is not altered  more specifically  the baseband spectrum is preserved  and so is every nth image spectrum  the other  n    in n image spectra are removed  where n is the oversampling rate    you are listening to   generally  these players run the samples thru an  all pass filter network   i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s  ideally the filter has a gain of   from  hz to      hz  and a gain of   from       to the new nyquist frequency  in practice a finite transition band is required  and there is also a certain amount of pass band ripple and stop band leakage  with a high order  eg     taps  digital filter  a very good approximation can be easily achieved        bit deleted about observations of interpolation filter at work       in case you care  the filtering method uses an fir  finite impulse response   filter   i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method   anybody out  there know the real answer   i d say that they use a tapped delay line with  resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering   this strikes me as  the most cost effective method for volume production runs   no  they actually use a digital fir just like yours  but built in hardware  on custom vlsi chips for  mainly  economic reasons     anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective    sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency   antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling   lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher   oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of   all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should   allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias   filtering    actually  i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that  they have a marketting gimic   i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to  filter an oversampled signal than not   you can use sloppier components and  give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp    it s too bad that they  charge more for something that  i think  is actually less costly to build   i guess that the answer is somewhere between the two   as an interesting     aside  some of you out there may be aware of a scheme used by pioneer and wadia  which is called  by pioneer  at least  legato link  i haven t heard one of these players  but by reading advertising blurb  and a couple of pseudo technical articles i deduced that all they do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter  and let a load of the first image  ie aliassed  spectrum through  talking to bob stuart  of boothroyd

  do they just send you some general information about the companies that  advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a  catalog    that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled  radio electronics compiles all of the cards  then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number  some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels  and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk   the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get  you will notice that the radio electronics information card  commonly called a  bingo card  in the industry  includes lines for a company name and a business phone number  my guess would be that the big  national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can  for example  if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone  and a mail stop   tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later  if you leave it blank  odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet  medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog  and then some companies  like digikey or jameco  have nothing to mail out accept the catalog   a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards  free  industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer  they use the information at least three ways  they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you  through repeated mailings  to re subscribe  they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics  this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that      of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors   and finally  some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information  for example  tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic s  in the past   months   the other point  in the data the advertiser receives  many magazines include how many items you circled on the card  if they want  the advertiser can attempt to cull out the  literature collectors  from the serious potential customers    can you say qualified sales leads  i thought you could    what s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards     never circle more than   number on the card  if you want more   than   items  use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later     if you are really  really serious and you really  really want   the information  call the advertiser and ask  this will also   cut about    days off the the response time  virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout     to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you re   not really  qualified  for  send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers     include a business name and phone number  even if it s your house

way  no document look up  no disk wear and tear   i did not say that the originals would allow only one install   the user s  conscience should do that   i know  i ll get flamed for this     but with the increasing number of  casual  users who either unknowingly or don t care about the software copyrights  it s the truth   i have  friends  who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time  and when i refused  they went after somebody else    casual pirating is becoming more of a problem   some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying   i ve seen what some of my  friends  dug up somewhere     latest and the greatest games  all cracked  within days of actual release   you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz   two   yes  two    and don t ask me which ones they are    determined pirates are unstoppable  given enough time  but their results do not spread  that far  since pirate boards are not that well known  and easily tracked once found by authorities   it is the  casual  pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage   what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup  registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the above  two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus violated their license agreement   this way  the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal  discomfort  who does major upgrades to their computer frequently   as only problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer   the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights  and can restore to different machines   on the other hand  the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is  supposed to be   if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was not  supposed to be  we know who has broken their license agreement   of course  a hacker can break that eventually  but that s not the point  is it     kasey chang  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  mchen terra cs psu

unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program  and some self rewriting code to confuse some people   also  make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger   another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk  just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector    to help you here  you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph  make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well  or they  wanna be crackers  can just look for the junk in some random sector   like you mentioned  there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys  but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user  which you is the opposite of what you want   another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of   if the program does not find that this is the same system  it requests being installed by the original disk again   the original disk should be encrypted  compacted  have many sectors that should be checked  and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied   once again  you must put code encryption  self rewriting code  and multiple crc checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed   among other things  this also protects your program from virii   if the program detects a change in its code  tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program   tell them the program is  virus secure   and remember  you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses   feel good   i hope that i have helped   have fun   knock some cracking out  well  you can

com  robert g  carpenter  writes       i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the    distance between a transmitter s  and receiver     yes  it s called radar  well  actually not quite  both radar and radio altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal  then receive its reflection from a target  radar generally uses pulses  while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave transmission  in the case of the latter  highly accurate distance measurement can be made  as an example  the original bendix ala    radio altimeter was accurate to     foot at      feet altitude   note  however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about  the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers  this cannot be wire connected  since radio waves will actually travel faster in free space  air  in this case  than wire  the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable   so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance  etc  something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick  triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously  sound expensive  not too bad  but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort   why not go to a different method  surveyors use a laser light system where again the reflection time is measured  why not try this   sounds like something a p e  should know about anyway          seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength    and determine distance  this would be for short distances       ft      and i would need to have accuracy of   inches  or so   this is actually highly inaccurate  since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit  there are variances in the antenna and transmission line  and the receiver may also vary  both from unit to unit  and the same unit over time  you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system  with the radio altimeter this is also done  but since everything is located at one place  it is much easier to do  note especially that the time base for the r a  receiver and transmitter is one unit also      depends on the environment  in a static environent such as a waveguide yes  in  a dynamic environment  with objects moving about  the multipath kills this  concept   nope  fm capture effect says that

point is to make   sure the   user is using a legitimate copy   the simplest and virtually fool proof   way is   for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed   on    some sort of checksum  serial number  whatever  so a copy put on a   different   machine  not installed from original disks  will not work        okay  so what do you do if some part of the machine  presumably the part   on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself   upon goes bad  you replace that part  and now your program won t run   because it s on a  different  computer     this is  of course  assuming that the program uses something in rom  like   the bios serial number  maybe   and not a disk based code number     obviously if the drive goes bad you ll be reinstalling the stuff anyway   i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system     we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred   machines  both pc and macintosh  as well as administering a network of   over    next machines   i personally am concerned only with a small lab   with ten pc s and ten mac s    i m not the manager  but help him with   admin often    imho  copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more   than a major headache for the legitimate user   anyone who wants a copy of   your program and doesn t care about legality will get a copy   period      pirate board  or no pirate board   i too have  friends  who blatantly and   quite successfuly  hack  copy protection schemes practically in their   sleep   let s consider what goes on in our lab   almost daily we have at least one   machine down  sometimes several  due to some goofball screwing up some   setting or other on a piece of software   admittedly  we  being students    mostly  are not the world s most efficient and effective network   administrators  but we try   keeping even the twenty machines that are    partly  my responsibility even vaguely looking and  acting  similar to   the average user  and maintaining  behind the scenes  consistency is a   real headache  but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his   disk   often we have hardware problems at peak  business  times and have to do   some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily         well  i ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all         the point is  often we have to re install software and copy configuration   files etc  from machine to machine   by far the easiest way we have found   to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to  then   copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine  of that   machine s type    this ensures us that  for at least ten minutes  we have   ten identical machines to work with   having them networked simplifies   this considerably  as our major packages  wordperfect  windows  etc   are   all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with   often  however  we need to install a package requested by some instructor   to one  some  or all of the machines for a special project   this is   usually a hand written or shareware etc  program similar to what i believe   the original poster was asking about   the few we have had with  copy   protection  schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain         in short  don t waste your time with a copy protection scheme   it s sort   of like outlawing guns   the criminals will get your program anyway  and   you will only be hurting the legitimate  honest user   write a good user s   guide and tech manual  whatever else for your program  please do this   regardless of whether you copy protect the thing      and only distribute   the manual to licensed users   jack the price to cut your losses  but   please take a cue from the major companies  who can admittedly afford the   costs of illegal copies far better than you  and don t burden the   legitimate user with a  copy protection  scheme    sorry for the tirade  but it s been a long day here              mark s  underwood ee student  university of kentucky lab assistant

after somebody else      casual   pirating is becoming more of a problem   some sort of copy protection   will   discourage the casual copying   i ve seen what some of my  friends  dug   up

ask me which ones they are      determined   pirates are unstoppable  given enough time  but their results do not   spread    that far  since pirate boards are not that well known  and easily   tracked once   found by authorities   it is the  casual  pirates that the copy   protection is   determined to discourage       what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus   a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup    registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the   above    two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and   makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is   encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a   stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus   violated their license agreement       this way  the legitimate users who does not register will experience   minimal    discomfort  who does major upgrades to their computer frequently   as   only   problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer       the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and   therefore   gains full rights  and can restore to different machines   on the other   hand    the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is    supposed to be   if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was   not    supposed to be  we know who has broken their license agreement   of   course    a hacker can break that eventually  but that s not the point  is it         kasey

a discharged state  will develop a condition i think is called sulfation   in storage  either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use  fat chance i d ever do that at home   or the battery should be stored on a trickle charge   i have also  i think  read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a long period of time  the refernce i remember is to use c     where c is the amp hours  as the charging circuit  and leave it hooked up for weeks   some of this may only apply to gel type cells  but i suspect the same applies

we d had them  sometimes    i think murphy s law holds true more often than newton s    when we needed    them   i think it s sortof like snake antivenin           of the time you    have absolutely no use for it  but when you need it  boy do you ever need    it     ditto s     in fact    at work  where things are dead if the backup is no good  i insist on having at least a   level backup system    it seems that whenever you have   good backups  you never need them   but if you don t have them  murphy guarantees that you ll suffer for it    i don t have backups of my originals at  home  but then my machine doesn t    see anywhere near the use abuse of these here at the lab  and so i    consider it less of a risk   still  i usually make  working copies  of    them when i install them and

suggestions  on audio relays      in article  c qsbf iek ms uky edu   billq ms uky edu  billy quinn  writes     i built a little project using the radio shack  vdc relays to switch    audio   i got pretty bad  clicks  when the thing switched   i was doing    most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and    nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks         my question is          is there a good relay relay circuit that i can use for switching    audio  so that there will be  no  noise of any kind on the audio lines         i will appreciate any advice or references to advice   also  exact part    numbers company names etc  for the relays will help   the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component  intentional or not  on the audio lines to be switched  if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level  let s say they re capacitively coupled   then putting a    k resistor from each input to ground  and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click   if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage  then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own   if you have more than one relay  each relay switching one input through to a common output   you can use make before break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change  this may mask the switch click   an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor  ldr  sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink  many broadcast consoles use this older  but time honored technique  claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this  but i don t have a part number handy  radio shack has a ldr grab bag            you might want to try   for a simple  solid state clickless switch that is cheap  you might try  looking at the cd     analog switch that is commonly available  or its older predecessor  the        again  the dc component must be removed prior to switching  other alternatives include jfet switches  both discrete and ic  and diode switching  which works relatively well  surprisingly   all the above  with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi page article   solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state  techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch  differential switching  and slowing the risetime of the control pulse  with the       cutting the click can be as simple as putting   k     k resistors in series with the control pins   hope this helps at least get you started

current limiting  acollins uclink berkeley edu  andy collins  writes     one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys         for our class project  we need to design and build a power supply   to the following specs       voltatge   adjustable from     v   current     limited  at  a      voltage must stay within    of designated value for i from    a   ac ripple less than   mv  rms       of course  we can t just use an adjustable voltage  current limiting   regulator chip          our problem is with the current limiting  i e  we ve found stuff to   do the rest of the parts of the circuit    what the supply must do    if presented with a load which would draw more than  a  given the   supply voltage  is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal   one amp   thus  if we were to short the thing with the ammeter  we   should read one amp   if we measure the current through a   ohm    resistor at   v  we should read one amp  and the output voltage  by   necessity  must be  v       the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves   a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output    power transistor  and therefore reduce the output       so  does anybody have any ideas we could work from       thanks in advance       andy collins  kc yey   acollins uclink berkeley edu      ps  if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project  i agree fully        but i still have to do it  its graded         you can design for ramp shutoff  brick wall current limit or even  fold back cutoff    sounds like you want  brick wall  current limit   your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base  drive  in order to get the brick  wall  you need enough voltage gain on  the current sensor   normally a darlington on the current sensing  resistor will be adequate  but for infinite gain   use an op amp to sense  the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to  turn off the base bias on the series pass transistor   phase compensation  may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more  than     degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok

implement the above plus    a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup     registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the above     two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and    makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is    encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a    stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus    violated their license agreement        you take two copies with a different registration id  compare them byte for    byte and you know where they are located  usually you will be able to    find out what is what after that     probably  but the point is the company make the registration patch  not  you   sure  you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes   but why   it s not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking    problem about people who cut too much from quoting        and what

i ve had something similar in mind  what if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address  data   when the user registers  you don t even need to send executable code   just compute his her key and send him her instructions to enter in the  appropriate place the following   name joe doe address     main street city anytown  ca key ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd  every user needs a unique key   the executable can propagate as much as you  like  the author can respond to the registration by e mail  post card   whatever   unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else s name  showing up  maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message     authorized users can make as many copies as they like  upgrade their  machines  whatever   the main

characteristic   if the user    did an upgrade to the machine  he she should reinstall all programs any way     no document look up  no disk wear and tear        this is not a good idea   i upgraded my motherboard last fall   i  would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to  reinstall simply because i changed motherboards     opinion is understandable        i assume you have a tape drive   not all of us have about     floppies around for backup  you know       any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum   are you  going to require that a user re install all their software if they add  mb  of ram to their computer   i did that a couple of weeks ago   it s in the  bios  and if software had told me  this isn t the machine you installed me  on  i would never have used that software again   really bad idea    ram is something you add all the time  so no   it s more like bios manufacturer and or processor type          etc    data cannot be used

for update         it would be perfectly reasonable     sort of        i did not say that the originals would allow only one install   the user s    conscience should do that        this is silly   it s much easier to loan disks to a friend and let  them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk  and then give  them that   your scheme isn t going to stop anyone    of course it is easier   are you saying then the originals should allow only one install   what is your point        you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable    the quiz   two   yes  two    and don t ask me which ones they are        do you know any assembly language at all   all anyone needs to do if  find the part of the code that does the quiz  and insert a jmp instruction  to just completely skip it   not that difficult  really   and there is very  little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing   using pklite or  some similar utility would help  but only if the resulting compressed  exe  were tagged as uncompressable    i know x   and    x  assembly quite well  thank you   i know exactly which two bytes need to be changed  i have the code to do them too   i just said  don t ask me which ones    i didn t say i don t know what that means   such hacking can be easily discouraged by adding anti patching code which does a self check upon execution and refuse to load if crc does not match value stored  encrypted  of course  in the program   it could be claimed as a part of anti virus code  and it would not be far from the truth         what i believe the

to the question of   what s your name  so this won t stop them in the long run    did anyone read what i wrote   that is not what i wrote   or meant      what i said was the program should have certain restriction  such as the restrict to one machine  until the program is registered with the manufacturer   the manufacturer will then supply the then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the  registered to xxx  screen       pirates are always going to win this fight   they simply have more  time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme    of course they will  but that was not my point   the purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates   oh  can i have a copy of that    sure  here    and the less sophisticated pirates   let s look for all those calls to int  h         any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed   they can always backtrace the entire load sequence of the program   the point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses  or to minimize such intrusion  of legitimate use   pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them  and no amount of copy protection will stop them  but the rest of us will be stopped   how many of these hardcore pirates are there

 carter ames  writes         why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead  totally unuseable    when stored on a concrete floor        i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle   from the unheated garage this year   to preserve them  and i just   went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work  but    they act like the two terminals are shorted   i asked a friend   and he said that you should never do that   cause it ruins them    but he couldn t tell me why     this topic was beaten to death a year or so ago     the concrete is not the problem      lead acid batteries often fail from disuse  not being charged for a long  time   but there s no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the  problem   the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate  that s why the old wives  tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast      it insulates the battery thermally  it you ll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam  it will self discharge even slower  the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly  but also trickle charge it every couple days too to  shallow  cycle  the charge in the battery  such mild  exercising  of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage  if you do remove the electrolyte  may sure you keep separate

 when stored on a concrete floor       i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle  from the unheated garage this year   to preserve them  and i just  went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work  but   they act like the two terminals are shorted   i asked a friend  and he said that you should never do that   cause it ruins them   but he couldn t tell me why   i don t see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the battery   however  you would have been better off leaving them outside  keeping them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside  a warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold one   when you are storing a battery it s a good idea to charge it once a month  letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it  i suspect this is what caused your problems                                                                                       robert wiegand   motorola inc  wiegand rtsg mot com

batteries   concrete   neal cmptrc lonestar org  neal howard  writes    the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a  colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate  that s  why the old wives  tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works  to help keep from killing the battery as fast      it insulates the battery  thermally  it you ll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam  it will  self discharge even slower   there are a number of inaccuracies here     in fact  a colder battery will self discharge more slowly   this is why    batteries should be stored in a cool  dry place     an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed    on wood   the battery  the wood  and the concrete will all be at the    same general temperature  ignoring temperature fluctuations  and thus    none will effect the other    the best thing would be to attach a small load  such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it  on constantly  but also trickle charge it every couple days too to  shallow   cycle  the charge in the battery  such mild  exercising  of a lead acid  battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for  storage   there is no need to  exercise  the battery   just keep it charged    a trickle charger will do the job     stuff deleted

 neat      you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage      can you tell us more about what you re doing  sounds like a very cool program   tis  only a gleam in my eye at this point   i have yet to chose a tracking  method   the initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage   i did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition   and dancers stand still alot  so their ir signature goes away   the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body  or body part   and the velocity of said body  this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture   dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies  but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked   the current toy i have been working with is a program called mandala for the amiga  used with a live  video digitizer   this works with a video camera  trained on the stage   you can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view  and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event  events can be midi objects or sequences  amiga sounds or graphic objects   it s been fun to play with  but the documentaion is arcane  and the digitizer is noisy  still  it s very appealing  the dancers don t have to wear any appliances  you can have ots of zone s  it speaks midi  which can be used to control lights  and i don t have to build any electronics   it s all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments   i have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic  but i have hopes      newsgroup  sci electronics

anything that puts out serious    amps    i know it can be done  i have some  v    a guts on my    bench  but something puzzles me  i m using a simple choke as     the storage element  basicly a toroid with a single winding     but all commercial models use transformers with many windings     i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for    the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose    me    what are they for  better than that  anyone have a full    schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of  i d    love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such    low volume      most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage  that s handled by the big caps on the primary side  those which in a  linearly regulated power supply would be considered the  filter  caps  coming right after the bridge   the transformer is just that   a  transformer   it s there primarily to step the voltage up or down    although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible  as anyone who s zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a  snubber  diode across it would tell you   actually  many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in    the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this  in a somewhat simplified manner    the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage  more or less unregulated dc rail   the energy storage  or  filter   caps appear across this rail  as does the switching transistor  the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer  resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary  which  are then rectified and filtered   at least one of the transformer s outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor  which acts in a  pulse width modulation   pwm  fashion to control  by varying the pulse width  the amount of energy being dumped into the primary  and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary   the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will  more or less tracking the regulated output  or they may have some additional linear regulation added   you may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the pwm control  which is most typically an ic  is not done via a direct electrical connection  this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated   often  the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement   while the transformer isn t the primary energy storage device in these designs  this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored  besides the inductive  kick  giving the switch transistor a bad time  as noted above   you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went  in  to the transformer back  out  again  one way or another  in some designs  this happens more or less automatically   but in others  you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn t saturate  which again would have disastrous results  best left to the  imagination         i m not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer   hopefully  a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above    bob myers  kc ew   hewlett packard co        opinions expressed here are not                    systems technology div    those of my employer or any

couldn t tell me why     it s not the concrete floor that does it  the problem is that lead acid cells self discharge over time  even high quality cells  gates for instance  will discharge        over

      the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer   results in much less spread than ink drop technology   in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc  can happen     it doesn t take much investigation to see that the mechanical and   electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than   inexpensive ink jet printers   recall also that laser printers   offer a much higher throughput      ppm for a laser versus about     ppm for an ink jet printer   a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the  first  sheet take to print  inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer   i have a        and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer   a sage said to me   do you want one copy or lots of copies     one     inkjet       something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the   life of the printer   a      page yield toner cartridge is about    us       at discount while hp high capacity            page yield    cartridges are about  us    at discount   it could be that over the   life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are   less than ink jet printers   it is getting progressively closer   between the two technologies   laser printers are usually desinged   for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product   replacement cycles   paper cost is the same and both can use refills  long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts  consumables  and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer   hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver    there is one wild difference between the two printers  a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer  this

of people and software  it seems that a good majority of people  say      will at some point copy a friend s program   gee  you really oughta try this   or accept a copy  these are people who normally would buy a software package or do without  but decided that just once it wouldn t matter   the last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one  computer  most people aren t going to

processing   all the camera store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart  toss the film cassette into the to be processed bin  and throw the battery in one trashcan and the

 they were left in their places that they needed to be   one in the riding lawnmower  what a lux  and one in each motorcycle   the battery in the  riding lawnmower was about     years old  and one of the cycle batteries  was new  and one was around   years old   upon spring time  i discovered that all of the batteries were dead  and needed to be recharged   they all worked properly  except for the older ones  and they had to be replaced  about halfway through the summer    they had originally been stored in the garage  and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring    last year  i decided to bring them in to the basement  which has two parts  one is dirt and brick  and the other is concrete   i brought in all three  and discovered in the spring   about    days ago  that not only were the batteries dead  but when i put the charger on them  the charger said  hmmmmmmmm  and  the amp meter read around                 in other words  it was pinned  the internal circut tripped  and i went on to the other batteries   they were the same       realizing that we still had   gigantic sailboat batteries  also lead acid  i decided to put the charger on them    these had been sitting for around   and a half years  on the brick and dirt part  and noticed that they only needed a small charge  around   hours or so on trickle   i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts  and they worked fine for around    of  em     this leads me to believe one of several things          i bought really    tty batteries last year   sorta true          the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the         batteries          there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the            room where the concrete is           the

feet underground  there isn t going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it s sitting on        question   why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the   surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it   because the temperature of your hand   unlike that of the battery   is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss   you re feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object  your hand  which is kept much warmer than its surroundings   in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production  this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings  if it started out not in equilibrium with them  but won t affect the final temperature   for the same reason  windchill affects

noise built in   most all from audio  control have them i know the c     does       with regards to what you wrote  how does one  adjust for room dynamics  and stuff like that    i asked a professor that question just last week and he didn t really know himself   since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states  say  the surface of the silicon where there s a lack of a covalent bond  that act as  traps  to nearby elecrons  and since this happens at low frequencies  because at high frequencies they aren t able to  trap  electrons   how do you compensate for that   it seems to me that you wouldn t be able to compensate for pink noise   i have seen the  pink noise  feature  however  on many eqs  and i was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to  man made noise  like power lines  crosstalks  coupling  etc   if you have any information about this  it would be appreciated   hope this didn t sound too drawn out   thanx

 wrong  it had     bytes of ram from the riot   this was multiply mapped into  both page    pseudo registers  and page    stack   and also throughout the  bottom  k of memory   tia registers also sat in this address space     as     bytes of ram was somewhat limiting  some later cartridges also carried  ram themselves  which was interesting as atari had provided no write line  to the cart   this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address  range  and the writes into another  but all the time this scheme ate into  the  very  scarce rom address space            ian     newsgroup

is about     feet from the road         might be a couple of hundred watts  from the sound of it   kicking sound   out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a   mighty strong carrier    i ve heard of linears so powerful that   triggering them while the car was idling  would stall the engine by   pulling down the battery voltage    it would take a lot more than that  it sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off   but just goes to a standby situation   i suspect that the stories are just that  stories   the voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously  when you try to jumpstart someones  car  when your vehicle is at idle  does your car stall  no  the other car just does not crank well   now  the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with  when the extra current is drawn  the idle speed will drop   as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement      is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company  the fcc  or both       ultimately it s likely to be your problem to resolve  i m afraid   the   fcc is so understaffed that they don t pay much attention to citizen   complains about rfi  or so i ve heard     they ll just send you a   pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures       talking to the power company might help   they might be able to install   filtering devices at your service panel  or recommend a type which you   could have installed by a licensed electrician    a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power  if surges are occurring there  it is due to another cause   not a transmitter     unfortunately  there s a fair chance that enough signal is being picked   up by your house wiring that a simple service panel filter won t   suffice   you may need to install heavy duty rfi filters at the power   connections of your affected equipment   it is probably not that much of a problem  often   toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem  it will not solve internal equipment deficiencies     if the problem occurs regularly  you may need to  stake out  the street   in question  and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by   at the time interference occurs   if you can identify the vehicle which   is transmitting  you may be able to contact its owner and complain   it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault  if the person is an amateur  then he she will probably be willing to help   if you explain that the person is causing

isn t likely   every bit of signal that doesn t go out the   antenna is wasted  as far as a ham is concerned  and most hams are  it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem     technically competent to ensure that they don t waste any signal if they   can possibly avoid it   to get their ham license  they had to pass a   government exam that tests them on that point  among others       however  you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure   there are   lots of other services where the operators aren t required to be   technically competent   citizens band   cb    for example   there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all  it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers   however  that said  most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill     listen to the interference   if you hear voices clearly  it almost   certainly isn t ham radio  and might well be cb   if you can record a  don t count on that     bit of it  you could take the tape over to a local ham operator s house   and ask him for his opinion of what you re hearing   most communities  you cannot do that legally  however  you can ask a ham over to listen  if the interference occurs at a specific time each day  then it would be possible to do such scheduling   if nothing else  you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway  to see if he interferes  if he does  then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference     have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing   to help you resolve interference complaints   look in the phone book  or   ask at the local ham radio store  or call the fcc for contact info   the fcc may  or may not  have such information  they have enough to do without getting calls for such information  if nothing else  call your city offices or police department  general business number   they should have the name of a local ham contact     if it s a ham  he s more than likely willing to help get rid of the   problem   after all  it would be his signal he s wasting   if it isn t    the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions   see above   your concept of wasted signal is erroneous  if his rig is transmitting properly  then the chance of interference  with the exception of harmonic television interference  is the greatest   since he is putting out the strongest signal     it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is   operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a   piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of   the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device   that wouldn t affect one person in a thousand  but which bites you    often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable   person  perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you re   hearing   unfortunately  most consumer equipment is succeptable   it is all poorly designed      btw  hams are allowed amplifiers  cb isn t    illegal ham amplifier    doesn t

carts used to say they re dated for only   months  but i don t think they say so anymore  we stick to a   month supply  of about   carts   we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper  after fooling for a long time  laser xerox paper is also good   smearing doesn t happen  unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine  other disadvantages are   no postscript  this can be an advantage in speed  usually   ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press software solutions  i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet  but they won t release it for fear of hurting lj sales   in the end  the primary advantages of laser are true postscript  unless you go for cheap lasers   and fused toner  no smearing  even when soaking in water   lasers are slightly sharper  but the only instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board transparencies for photoetching  i found a textronix color phaser

stuff about hardware keys    if you put another computer on the port instead of the key  you can hack   them by reading what happens  so i ve been told  i ve never seen this done   but i think it s possible  you d need some hardware knowledge and some   software to read the port   true  which is why many of the newer keys ship out  oh  maybe    bits or so  have the key encrypt them  and return them to the pc   making a bunch of these    bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things won t run without the key       anyway  then  this scheme at least defeats your approach   it s a little costly  though   personally  i don t believe in copy protection  and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what

series with the tip or ring lines  of the phone wire  which ones are  those  suppose i am holding a regular phone wire  such that the little  plastic tooth  on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead  ends that you plug into the phone  is facing down  and away from me   which of the   wires that i see is the  tip  and which is the  ring    please reply to mlevin husc  harvard edu     mike levin   mike  ring is the red wire  tip is the green wire of most standard phone lines  they two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone  the two live lines   they are the two innermost connectors of an rj    phone jack   another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to green  ring to tip  tip green being at ground potential of the voltmeter   it should read     volts in the on hook no ring position   i am     sure it s     v and not     volts  doesn t hurt a phone too much if they re reversed  it s just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere    additionally  when off hook  the voltage drops to about    to    volts dc  i think it is supposed to correspond to a    to    ma current loop  and lastly  when ringing  the two wires develop an ac potential of about    v p p at    to    hz across them  where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from    hope that clears things     squish endor harvard

a seeker born every minute   writes          where can i buy blinking leds besides radio shack            does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate   by voltage      i guess  if so  what hertz  pulse  rate are they adjustable or set to          i d like blinking leds that can be set for approx   hz     hz            hz  or    hz  something like that    i m interested in what s       out there for flash rates  i like the idea of leds with flasher        circuits already in them  i hate soldering ics in general  guess i       don t have a hell of a lot of patience              thanks              dana   if you want slow led flash rates  adjustable by switches  or by a           digitally controlled switch   i suggest looking at a     oscillator chip  they cost     at radio shack  much cheaper in quantity at quality places   and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a     oscialltor notebook  i think forest mims has one at radio shack   you ll have to toy with resistor capacitor values or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies  any engineer worth his salt  can make a     osciallator    it s in the book  and left up to you to see  i hate doing ascii circuit graphics   the     can accurately go from a few hz to about     khz  i think    about the tape recorder gizmo  you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a data line  for flashing led   and one as audio line  for voice or music   this would eliminate a lot of noise   the data line is probably most easily done by some kind of pll or bandpass filter  using just an op amp   the     chip is a good pll  and not hard to work with  however if you nothing about how a pll works  i suggest you don t try this  op amp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack info booklets  and the popular     op amp is a snap to work with  setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy  so i would suggest the     method firstmost    i have no idea what this is going into  so i am really generalizing     as for manufacturing techniques  if you re only goofing with it  i suggest you breadboard the thing    no need to solder  wire wrap would be the next  more permanent step  and lastly  soldering pcb making  hope that clears things         squish endor harvard edu   newsgroup  sci electronics document id

camter   astro ocis temple edu  carter ames  writes          i thought the first thread was hilarious  so here goes another post       some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries         one year  i left the batteries in the garage   the garage is unheated      they were left in their places that they needed to be   one in the riding   lawnmower  what a lux  and one in each motorcycle   the battery in the    riding lawnmower was about     years old  and one of the cycle batteries    was new  and one was around   years old   upon spring time  i discovered   that all of the batteries were dead  and needed to be recharged   they all   worked properly  except for the older ones  and they had to be replaced    about halfway through the summer    they had originally been stored   in the garage  and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring      last year  i decided to bring them in to the basement  which has two parts    one is dirt and brick  and the other is concrete   i brought in all three  and   discovered in the spring   about    days ago  that not only were the batteries   dead  but when i put the charger on them  the charger said  hmmmmmmmm  and    the amp meter read around                 in other words  it was pinned    the internal circut tripped  and i went on to the other batteries   they   were the same         realizing that we still had   gigantic sailboat batteries  also lead   acid  i decided to put the charger on them    these had been sitting for around   and a half years  on the brick and dirt part  and noticed that they only   needed a small charge  around   hours or so on trickle   i tested them   by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts  and they   worked fine for around    of  em       this leads me to believe one of several things            i bought really    tty batteries last year   sorta true            the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the           batteries            there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the              room where the concrete is             the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air            better than concrete        btw  i can almost waterski in the dirt room            any other ideas         could be the aliens  anything is possible         the lead acid secondary cell releases energy  electricity  with the following chemical reaction    pb   pbo     h so       pbso     h     lead and lead  iv  oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water   the standard heats of formation at    c     f  of the various compounds are                  heat of formation compound      at    c  kcal mole                                     pb                      pbo                    h so                     pbso                     h                          the heat of reaction at    c is therefore       kcal per mole pbso  produced  note that lead sulfate is not very soluble         grams per     grams water at    c   and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring  or the cathode  positive terminal  of the battery    i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms  but i may be wrong   oh well  i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate  and i don t feel like thinking through it right now     what is important to notice here is that the reaction  as you knew it would be  is exothermic  or energy discharging   if moisture with dissolved electrolytes  acid rain  condenses on the battery  a conductive path between the terminals may form   this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds  the reaction is reversible  if electricity  from an alternator or battery charger  is put back into the battery    lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge   each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction   the non reacting posts  terminals  of the lead acid battery are there to remove  or add  electric energy during a discharge  or charge    because the reaction is exothermic  it has a tendency to happen  though quite slowly under normal circumstances   so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea  it is not a total solution    to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth  dirt   one should recall lechatelier s principle  which can be paraphrased as   anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position   here are the thermal

thermal conductivity for  dirt   diatomaceous earth  goes down with temperature   also      c is about     k  and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth   the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of    greater than that of dirt  and is     times greater than wood    it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood   at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring  energy is being released  either as electricity or heat    thermal conductivity of air is about       btu  hr ft ft  f ft    during storage  except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery  this energy is mostly released as heat   the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface   thus  if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface  at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature  the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about    times faster than that on dirt    this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play   removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion   if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature  keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced   a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface   store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement  and you have   surfaces removing energy  which  pulls  the reaction along    also  if water evaporates from the battery  that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water   this will tend to drive the discharge reaction    jeff white      jhwhit

around for backup  you know      actually  no i don t have a tape drive   in the event of a total hard disk failure  i reinstall the apps from originals  and restore the data from the backups i keep of that   with upwards of    mb of stuff on my hard disk  there is no way i m going to try and back it all up without a tape drive      would be nice to have one though     ram is something you add all the time  so no   it s more like bios   manufacturer and or processor type          etc    data cannot be used    esp with these new flash rom bios machines with updates on a diskette    maybe  maybe not   today it doesn t happen as often  i would hope   but then if a bios is buggy and the user gets an upgrade  the bios information is going to change  at least the date anyway   tagging the bios manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard   this type of upgrade doesn t require a hard disk backup restore     on the other hand  to make this less intrusive it could be disguised as    please insert original disk  xx as i need file yyyyyy for update           it would be perfectly reasonable     sort of    as long as it wasn t done too terribly often   otherwise i think it would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software         this is silly   it s much easier to loan disks to a friend and let    them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk  and then   give  them that   your scheme isn t going to stop anyone      of course it is easier   are you saying then the originals should allow   only one install   what is your point    of course not   if something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled  the  worst  thing i want that software telling me is  this software has already been registered to  blank  and it is against the law to install it on other machines    or something similar  access for windows does this and it only requires a click on  ok  to go away   pretty non intrusive  but it gets the point across     what i said was the program should have certain restriction  such as the   restrict to one machine  until the program is registered with the   manufacturer   the manufacturer will then supply the   then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction   and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the  registered to xxx  screen    this is a great idea   i like the key system that some shareware products use   the only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost

word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage  converted to a sawtooth wave  to get a duty cycle  however  i am leary of this method because it a  requires a lot of parts  and  more importantly  b  creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line  i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference  but that would require more parts and boost the price further   someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input   bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on chip  unfortunately  he couldn t remember the chip number or the manufacturer  if anyone else has heard of this chip  please e mail me   i am building this project as a  dimmer box  for a light controller circuit and it is important that the

silver solder is not used for general soldering tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth  silver solder  when exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field  will actually grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field  for this  reason  silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies  fortunatly  tin lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites as fast as silver solder  therefore  it is used extensively     jerry long  long spk hp com

    units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side  viewed from front  of the printer   newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide   the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out   there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation   hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism   i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer   i don t have the information handy   i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit   hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade   i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet       the kit was fairly expensive   you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet     now that prices have declined so much   upgrading an original deskjet to     requires a fair amount of skill  but no soldering   upgrading a deskjet plus to a     is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts   contact your hp service center for further information   the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers  especially the newer laser printers   the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line   this makes no material difference for lasers  but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster   as you might guess  the result is hideously slow printing   the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior   from the way wordperfect works  this would not be easy to change   windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows    the pcl  dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page     dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory   an uncompressed image could be as large as about     kbytes  but the printer needs about    k of memory for its internal house keeping   laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations   deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts   a single page from a laserjet only requires about    seconds   this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer   the presumption  of course  being that the laser printer has completed its warm up cyle   until ink chemistry is changed  wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable   i won t use the word impossible  but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely  chosing an appropriate paper type helps  but does not eliminate the problem   laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components   hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges  mitigating the material waste problem to a degree   energy waste could use more work   warm up times have decreased  allowing stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv   kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system   the image drum is good for approximately    k copies   it is a very nice print engine   i wish hp used the kyocera engine   kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system   the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp s laser printers   the pick up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out   the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper  the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service   replacement cost for the transport is almost        the feed rollers are not separately replacable  though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician  i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer   it depends upon the application which printer is best for you   if you only print   or    pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output  the deskjet is a very good choice   as noted  the

not that the question is anything important  but i am still curious   why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green  i have seen  a few blue ones  but no red  yellow  company logo etc  is there a  technical reason or could it be that the marketing  geniuses  have  not tought about it  yet    the green layer is a solder mask  and is used to make a finished board look neat  and to avoid solder bridges  especially when using wave soldering  or any other mechanized approach   i ve seen red mask  but most that i ve seen are green   a bakelite board will look brown in colour  and  if the solder mask is put on  looks like a brown board with green  paint  on either side  or just one side  of the board  a fibreglass board will look green from the side  because the green solder mask makes the board appear that colour  if you got a fibreglass board with no mask  it would be a whitish grey colour  teflon boards do exist  as well    but i m not sure about that one   i d guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green  so they re not about to change  also  any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards  a lot of companies do not make their own boards    they ship them to a real boardhouse      newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  kschang sfsuvax  sfsu edu  kuo sheng  kasey  chang  subject  re

batteries part        the lead acid secondary cell releases energy  electricity  with the following  chemical reaction      pb   pbo     h so       pbso     h       lead and lead  iv  oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water  heats of formation deleted   the heat of reaction at    c is therefore       kcal per mole pbso  produced   note that lead sulfate is not very soluble         grams per     grams water  at    c   and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is  occurring  or the cathode  positive terminal  of the battery    i am almost  sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms  but i may be  wrong   oh well  i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate  and i don t feel  like thinking through it right now    the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution  pbso  is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out   also  h so  is in a water solution as  h    and so      thus the heats of formation of pbso  and h so  are for the most part irrelevant    what is important to notice here is that the reaction  as you knew it would be   is exothermic  or energy discharging   as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic  heat producing    more about this later    what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this   we re talking lead acid batteries of course  the battery slowly self discharges   as this discharge takes place two things happen   the level of pb   ions in the acid solution increases  i e  the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved            the level of h    ions in the acid solution decreases  i e  the solution            becomes less acidic  or more like water if you like   now  as the post to which i am responding correctly stated  pbso  will precipitate in a water  non acid  solution   when the battery dies  i e  is fully discharged  we end up with a high concentration of pb   and so    in water   so pbso  forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery  of course this happens in varying degrees  the more discharged  the more precipitate forms    the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery   if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate  more common in a newer battery  a dead short results   i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition  but they are for the most part useless   they can dissolve the pbso  but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly   you may have some success with these products for a newer battery    stuff deleted   to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on  concrete as opposed to wood or earth  dirt   one should recall lechatelier s  principle  which can be paraphrased as   anything subjected to some stress will  act to move to a more comfortable position   here are the thermal conductivities  of a some selected materials   stuff deleted   this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play   removing energy from  the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion   if the  reaction normally occurs at room temperature  keeping the battery at that  temperature requires the removal of any heat produced   a concrete surface is  a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface   store a battery in the corner  of a poured concrete basement  and you have   surfaces removing energy  which   pulls  the reaction along   this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid  in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures   a logical consequence of the above argument is this   if you really want your car to start  lower the battery temperature to      to  pull  the reaction along    we all know from experience  at  least those of us in canada do  it gets cold up here   that this is not true   if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery    besides which  there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature   the air would amply dissipate any  such heat  whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not   this  is of course irrelevant  since you would want the battery to be cool  during storage    just keep the battery in a cool dry place

filled fiberglass is blue    teflon is white      rubbish  the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used  older boards  bakelite and phenolic  rarely used a solder mask  these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques  and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them  these days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering  and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments   the light and dark green boards ofter seen have a  dry film  mask applied to them  usually applied as a complete film photographically produced   the blue  and red or orange  boards are a two part

such an expensive  metal       this is called silver bearing solder    it is used to solder to devices that have silvered contacts    one application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes    these were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches  if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic    the silver was quite thin    the    is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead     thus  no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution    other devices that use silver contacts are quartz

amps for    v service and running    v mains cables out  which will minimize the line drop   if these don t work  though  you re going to need a bigger generator   i assume that you re using well

piezoelectric accelerometers in them   i know that the gm cars use the setra units   the cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing automotive unit   incidentally  these things aren t very linear  but for the application they would do a fine job    scott  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  katop astro ocis temple edu  chris katopis  subject  phantoms in my sony strvx    receiver   while i have gotten     years out of this digital receiver  it has been acting verry strange of late   i hope that  the following  symptoms may help someone diagnose the error     i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had   has long died thus if i unplug it   it won t remember the presets    it has given up listening to the remote    i tried changing the remote s batteries  when i try a remote function   the receiver registers that it received it  a green remote light flashes  but the right function doesn t happen   if any function at all    also strange  when i hit  the  mute  button  for example  the display panel goes black   yikes   i ve never seen that before         before all the strangeness started  the system turned itself off and on again   by itself    sometimes it won t play a radio station  so i have to kinda twist it   yes kinda flex the motherboard  chasis  for it to get the radio tuning back   the aux in function always works however      it is inconvenient  but not inconvenient enough to pay an  expensive repair fee   while  i m not a hardware guy  i wonder  if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix  the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go      someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip    anyway     arghh  cjk    newsgroup  sci electronics document id

to the damaged disk  only read and use  the programs       hard for crackers to damage the disk exactly the same way     i remember a program called copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser  hole in it  i think it simulates the laser hole  after copying the disk the  program is  if necessary  used in conjunction with a program called nokey or  something   the program tells you which program to

exothermic   i am glad   you do not dispute this point   if you don t want the lead storage battery   to discharge  it should be stored such that its charged state is the   equilibrium state   during winter  the ground  be it covered with   concrete  dirt  or wood  maintains a cooler temperature on average than   the surrounding air or the battery   the heat capacity of air is less than   that of concrete  dirt  or wood  so it heats faster   conversely  air cools   faster  too       the normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated   garage or basement   the storage surface is often cooler than the   surrounding air  with the battery temperature somewhere in between   e g     the basement air temperature may be    f  the floor temperature    f  and   the battery temperature    f       the air temperature is higher than the battery temperature   the heat of   reaction is not going to move up the gradient   the floor temperature is   lower than the battery temperature  and heat is going to move to it   the   floor is an incredible heat sink        might depend on where you live    i know locally  for most of the winter  the ground  and concrete floor  within sheds and garages  unheated  is  signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature   the air does get  warmer during the day  but during the night  the ground and concrete  is definitely warmer  especially when protected by the walls from the  albedo effect   and the nights are longer by several hours than the  days      rest of quoted text deleted       jeff white       jhwhit   ulkyvx louisville edu    richard dell  sorry about following up my own article  but i wanted to continue that what might be being missed here is that the important thing might not be temperature differences per se  but the action of heat sinking the battery   perhap someone could conduct an experiment  taking two identical lead acid batteries  placing both on wooden shelves  but putting one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink   this would eliminate the  concrete floor effect   and keep both batteries at the same ambient temperature   i think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent  but the one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have some validity   richard dell   newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  et teal

underwater wireless communications  for a review  refer to  electrical experimenter   march      and june        rogers  methods were used extensively during the world war  and was unclassified after the war  supposedly  the government rethought this soon after  and rogers was convieniently forgotten   the bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send half of their signal thru the ground  the half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated  by the square of the distance   but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all  furthermore  the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception  the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise free   if you find this hard to believe  then refer to the work of the man who invented wireless  tesla  tesla confirmed that rogers  methods were correct  while hertzian wave theory was completely  abberant          et    tesla was     years ahead of his time  perhaps now his time comes

magazine and could have been   the circuit which is referred to here  this one used a   flyback transformer from a tv onto which you wound your own   primary windings  it also used   power transistors in a to              years ago i built a           volt tesla  and the thing was very  spectacular  but besides scaring amazing friends  depending on their  knowledge of science   and generating strong emi  i never found anything  useful that could be done with it      is there any real world application  for tesla coils today      david prutchi  first of all  realize that tesla invented ac power generators  motors  transformers  conductors  etc  technically   all  transformers are tesla coils   in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil  they mean an  air core resonant transformer   the tv flyback version tesla coil  see the  encyclopedia of electronic circuits  v         for diagram  has not an air core  it is of a class of circuit called  oscillating shuttle circuit   osc   generally osc s are highly efficient  but this version uses transistors and resistors  which are very lossy devices  typically tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors  so that he could achieve efficiencies of        and better  the usual application of an air core resonant transformer  or of an osc  is to produce strong emi for wireless broadcasts  how well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the hf hv tesla  flyback  coil from it  if we were to remove from our homes and industries all tesla coils  our lights would go dark  our cars would sputter and die  our radios would go silent  our industries would grind to a halt  and we would have to go back to using coal for heat  gas for lamps  horses for transportation  steam for power  and telegraph for communication  is that real world enough for you         get the message  we would not have       the convieniences we have today if not for tesla  give credit where credit is due   if it had been up to edison  we d still be in the   th century   flame me at your own peril  i m very good at putting edison down          et    tesla was     years ahead of his time  perhaps now his

timing  thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas  i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil  spec version of exar s xr      timer counter chip  it is stable down to     c and sucks very little power  they show an application for a ultra long time delay  up to several years depending on the rc time constant   in this application  they have two of them cascaded together  the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled  in this configuration  the output is high when the system is reset  when triggered  the output goes low and stays that way for a total of        x the timing cycle of the first chip  the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to       x r x c to        x r x c in     steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output  the beauty of it is  the timebase chip would only have to have a    uf timing cap and a    k resistor for      seconds per timing cycle  so i can get a maximum of             seconds between timing cycles       x        or about    days    of course  that s much more than i need     days   but the counter allows for     binary steps that can be selected for the output for the  pellet puker   after the first    days and it trips  it would reset its self for the next    day timing cycle and so forth   power is still a problem though  a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow  as an insulator  and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack  i like that idea     this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are    volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow  anyway  i ordered the xr      s to see what i can do with them  should be interesting  as long as i m not the one that

least  a fair idea of what s going on in a circuit  digital scopes    seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it  e g  even    when there are only a few samples per period  our hp     a displays a    continuous waveform  complete with non existing overshoots  i ve    waded through lots of manual pages and menus  but i haven t found yet    how to turn this off  it doesn t show which points have actually    been measured  as opposed to those which have been interpolated     either   perhaps you re using the wrong brand   sorry all hp fans  but i have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their  excellent  gear    one of the principal functions i look for when considering a dso is whether you can turn interpolation off  the other important feature is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i e  being able to lock the instrument into real time capture mode          secondly  i don t like menus  i want to see all common functions    with their own button   you ll have guessed i love analogue tek    scopes  i d choose a knob with printed legend over an on screen    display with up down buttons right away  the single knob of most    digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function    at the right moment       i agree with you here  the only consolation is that manufacturers are  beginning  to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus  however  to be fair  it seems that first time scope users  our students  seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a  real  scope         last but not least  you never know if the waveform displayed is old    or recent  noisy or just incoherently modulated  heck  you don t    even know if it really looks the way it s displayed  digital scopes    only show you a tiny fraction of what s going on  most of the time    the re busy computing things   this is one area that newer dsos are addressing  i recently evaluated the latest box from tek   their tds      which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard    mhz analogue cro  this instrument has a    mhz     ms s spec  meaning that it is  always  in real time capture mode  the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range  the downer is that the instrument uses menus again  but at least they appear to be logically laid out         there are only three situations for which i would prefer a digital    scope  looking at what happened before the trigger  looking at rare    events  and acquiring the data to have my computer play

  apr               kuhub cc ukans edu   wellison kuhub cc ukans edu writes     i have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design     what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer  what they want    to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount    of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a    selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the    snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured    as they come to the different color pellets         the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees     and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and    the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also     two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing    cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of      volts and are small in size  but again  the time of discharge at     or lower    degrees isn t linear  i was thinking of using several timers chained together     to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period  but that blasted cold and    the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain  one possibility would be to    use solar panels  but this is during the six month twilight  anyone have any    good ideas          thanks in advance                wes       firstly  i would never consider trying to make a one shot timer  your  f  cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute  rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current  their performance  in some respects  is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap  the other point is that big electro s are usually rated with         tolerances  so calculating exactly what capacitance you have  particularly when considering the cold    you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain  that  rolls over   from zero to maximum count  or vice versa  once every           seconds  if you were to use something like a    hz clock  you would need a divider chain of       to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period  of course  you could trim the    hz oscillator to give you exact time  but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at     is low anyway   i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit   caveat   i m not experienced in low temperature electronics  so i can t guarantee that this  or any other  approach is the best for inhospitable conditions   johnh

are all  ratios   the question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used  sometimes  this will be a reference power  such as   milliwatt  given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known  like    ohms in an rf circuit of that impedance   leading to an accepted notation of dbm  maybe it might be dbv  disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed  using   volt as reference  amplitude   rather than reference power   or  it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation  leading to just plain db  so  look at it this way   db  has an implied reference while notation such as  dbm  has an explicit reference   for power     db      log  p measured  p reference     for amplitude    db      log  a measured  a reference      b  is for bel  which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base     named after alexander graham bell  a  deci  bel is      of a bel  it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for the common founder s name  the small  d  large  b  is per si notation convention  i don t know anyone that s been crucified for messing it up   common references for audio are      dbm     milliwatt across     ohms    dbv     volt     vu  a zero on the vu meter       dbm   pro gear line level     vu      dbv  consumer gear line level    often times  a power amp vu meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the   db point  it is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment   note that in a circuit with a given  and maybe unknown  linear impedance  if the amplitude goes up so many decibels  the power will also increase the same amount  this proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm s law

where the gun assembly includes an accelerating    electrode at anode potential  most definitely does not provide that     connection    bob is indeed correct here in more than one way  a look in the

probably won t be too thrilled   with the      x     on this tube  but it  will  sync up and display it     i prefer at least a          for this resolution    since svga is    x       it ll do that too   the horizontal range probably goes lower than       but   i don t know if it goes all the way down to straight ntsc rate tv  which need   about       khz sweep    as far as  video compatibility   if i m reading   the question right  it won t take anything but analog rgb inputs   in other   words  it has no way to decode ntsc or y c video inputs   you would need   some sort of board to to this

the machine s ability to modify its own orders  under the control of other ones among its orders  is absolutely necessary for a flexible code  thus  if part of the memory is used as a  function table   then  looking up  a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify  or rather make up  the reference to the memory in the order which controls this  looking up   and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question   on the other hand  this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non trivial operation which we have to view it as    david cary  tenor  e  and comp

on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets    the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees   and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and  the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also   two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing  cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of    volts and are small in size    why are you fooling around with analog for this job   a single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily   an      only costs about      that and a    crystal and you re in business   embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket  power it from a solar cell  use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness   if you don t want to try thermal management  contact someone like icl and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal   it ll cost at most       if you use a single chip micro  you re looking at a parts count of  maybe     a processor  a crystal  two caps on the crystal  a power fet to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery   this is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable   add a power zener diode  for heat  and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to     pd assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros   this application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer s guide and create the binary with a hex editor   john     john de armond  wd oqc                interested in high

step the   vac supply voltage up to approx     vdv  as the load resistance increases  the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops  i need as high an output voltage as possible   about    v     the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages  ie    diodes and    capacitors  each capacitor develops about   v across them  and i take the output from across seven capacitors    v    each capacitor is    mfd at   v   if i increase each of the capacitors rating         mfd   that will increase the rc constant  and hence alleviate some of the problem  these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need    of them  so      what would happen if i connected a    mfd at    v capacitor in parallel  with the output  and hence in parallel with the seven    mfd capacitors     will it  as i assume  increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant  if it does  and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this  then i will have killed two birds with one stone    as i am experiencing some   hz ripple  and hence amp hum   and this new capacitor will  smooth  this out   and    can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor  choke  to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the   hz mains hum  lowest resistance possible      i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction      i m

bells and whistles  including soft keys  which i think are a    loveley touch    that is  software keys    you don t forget that you    are dealing with a computer  those scopes even with all their    neatness  still make the ickyest looking waves  lotsa features  but    ugly output  and those are the best digitals i have ever seen  i ve    seen a lot of cheaper digitals and they look terrible   i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis  and some of the functions are typically presented  in my opinion  in a counter intuitive fashion  hp has made some strides in their       series  imo   automatic setups are fine for simple  repetitive waveforms  but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring processing the event  for example  is the scope in  equivalent time  or in  real time  sampling mode  equivalent time being a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep   what was the scope s actual sampling rate at the time  how is the data being massaged after capture but before display  etc  one common misconception is the speed of the scope   is the hp scope you re using really a     mhz scope  or is it a    mhz sample rate scope     mhz single shot significance  whose front end including s h can support     mhz waveforms  important for equivalent time sampling   the     mhz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive  or on a single sample  when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time   so  there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope  i prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where i need storage for later analysis or comparison  when the event is within the capability of the scope  now  for the price of true     mhz digital scopes to fall                                                                                     dave medin   phone                  w      ssd  networking                    h

khz    passband     close  but no banana  to paraphrase garfield      the reason          hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy   khz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line  therefore     hz at the  bottom  and    hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise  interference with the next band     nowadays  digital trunks have made this less relevant  but the phone  companies still see no reason to improve quality  especially for free     therefore  digital  chunk of a trunk  segments still have a guaranteed  bandwidth of only  khz  so they can carry the equivalent of one

design   what i am looking for is a stable ultra long solid state timer  what they want  to do is to place this thing on the antartic ice shelf and measure the amount  of snow fall over a period of six weeks  every two weeks  they want to trip a  selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the  snow  then by digging down into the snow  the snow fall amount can be measured  as they come to the different color pellets     the problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold      degrees   and a power source that wouldn t drain  i have looked at the xr      timers and  the standard ne    dual timers  but thier temp specs won t go that low  also   two weeks equates to           seconds per firing  which means one big timing  cap   i have found     farad  yes  farad    caps that have a working voltage of    volts and are small in size  but again  the time of discharge at     or lower  degrees isn t linear  i was thinking of using several timers chained together  to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period  but that blasted cold and  the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain  one possibility would be to  use solar panels  but this is during the six month twilight  anyone have any  good ideas      thanks in advance            wes        just a suggestion  take a motorola mc     b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a rc or xtal clock input  then feed to a mc     b as clock input and decode output for           sec output  might have to add a few  and  gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the     to restart cycle    trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge  the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher   these ckts require uamps of current between        volts  so a    volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks  then take the ckt board   battery wrap in    or    of foam or build a box of out of the stuff   with plywood or metal exterior    build a small heater out of       watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm   nd thought use   batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger   insolate insolate       even though the chips state that the   al rated devices are good to     c   the batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity   oh make sure the area

passive  device much like the radio in your car   they work as an antenna picking  up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out   therefore there would  be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of  detecting whether some one had a radio in their car       from my rather rusty knowledge of radio  most radio receivers use a superhet  circuit  so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator  giving  a fixed intermediate frequency  if  that is more easily amplified  the detector detectors work by picking up if re radiated from your radar  detector  in britain  where one has used to pay for a tv licence  there  are were tv detector vans prowling the streets  looking for people who hadn t  paid their licence fee  they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof  and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if    i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna  and  how much from the rest of the module

applying an annihilation operator and creating a hole  and it is a   subtle question   the longer one works with them  the more real they   become   there are also quasi particles  which raise the

only exist in certain    semi conductors  the question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semi conductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor  say  copper      i don t want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors  rather i ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such

there i have to figure that in  it s kind of a pain in  the ass   is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem  the box would tkae the function generator

was built just last year  and the breaker box is wired the  same way      there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground in the breaker box   there also should be a connection of the neutral wire to a ground in the breaker box   there should be no other  place in the building where such a connection occurs  i e  not in any of the outlet boxes     the neutral  white  wire is a  grounding conductor  for the plug  and is not safe to touch  while the ground  green  wire is a  protective ground  and carries no current unless some kind of electrical fault has occurred   it s safe to touch the protective ground  but not to touch the  grounding conductor  because there is current in the grounding conductor  its outlet box end will not be at the same ground potential as its

to know if such a ground plane is also necessary in an analog  system      note  this ground plane will not be connected  except at one point  to  the signal ground      i keep getting conflicting answers over this  does having a ground plane  in an analog system help reduce noise also  my system only deals with  low frequency signals  up to    hz only       well  one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do   a continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield   do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things   this shielding won t do much good for magnetic fields  unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded  like a faraday cage   the flip side of the coin   if you are working with  very  high impedances  you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems  you aren t likely to encounter this at    hz  but at   khz  it can be a real problem

an led in series with a zener say around   v         on hook   led on        off hook   led off         would this work  if anyone tries tried it  please let me know              aye  there s the rub    if you draw enough current to light an led  the       equipment at the phone company will think you ve gone off hook        in the on hook state you re not supposed to draw current           which means you should just use your digital voltmeter  you can use an     old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think     there s something wrong with the cable              look guys  what s the problem here   if you want a light that goes on when     the  phone is  off  hook  all you need it to run it in  series  with the     line  as i mentioned in my previous post   if you want a light that goes on     when the  phone is  on  hook  all you need is a voltage threshold detector     if you re going to do the series diode thing  which is the easiest   just  make sure that the led can take the current  i can t recall it off hand  but  it s something like    ma or more    careful now folks    also consider the   vac     hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone s supposed to ring   even with a simple zener and led setup  you might end up with some carbon real quick   whatever scheme you use  make sure you ve got at least    v rated components on  the frontend   also remember that  if i m not mistaken  the phone line is a    ohm equivalent circuit   any current you draw from the   v or so gets dropped across that    ohms   that s fine until you re

something that made it sound like  you didn t realize something   on a typical ups  well  on ours  anyway    there is no switchover from ac to dc   all the protected equipment is  always running from the batteries  via an inverter   with the usual   condition of also having them on charge   if the power fails  big deal     the computers never see it  until the batteries start to droop  but   there s something like    car sized batteries in that cabinet  so it   takes a while      if you were gonna run the guts on straight dc instead of an inverter   why not do it all the time   then there d be no switchover to screw  things up  and no having to sense the failure fast   just keep the dc  on charge when the power is on  and it ll be there in zero time when  you  need  it     actually  it s a bit more complicated than that   i sounds to me  your ups takes in ac  rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries  and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again  feeding your equipment   this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since  as you mentioned  nothing will know about what happened down the line   another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power  and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power   the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat   unfortunately  most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available  so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable   ya sorta have to make it work with what there already   similar story with our telephone system   it was first invented back in the      s   we re still using the same damn system  media  as they did back then   if i have

we re wrong   we invite you to correct us  but please   quote references    the nec and the cec do not  in and of themselves  have the  force of law   many municipalities adopt it en toto   others   however  do not   check your with your local building  department  and  provincial  hydro inspection offices in  canada  to find out what applies in your area   also   your local electrical utility may also have special requirements  for electrical service installation   bear in mind  too  that  we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family  residences   multi family dwellings  mobile homes  commercial  establishments  etc   are sometimes governed by different  rules    also note that  contrary to popular belief in the u s   and in  some parts of canada   canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary  of the u s   consequently  the nec does not apply in canada   lots of things are the same  including voltages  line  frequencies  and the laws of physics   but there are a number  of crucial differences in the regulations   where we can  we ve  noted them  flagging the relevant passages with   nec   or    cec      remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards   it is often  smart to go beyond their minimal requirements   subject  what is the nec   where can i get a copy    the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the  national fire protection association  an insurance industry group   it s revised every three years   the      version has been released   you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore  or by calling them directly  at                the code exists in several versions   there s the  full text  which is fairly incomprehensible   there s an abridged  edition  which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses   and there s the nec handbook  which contains the   authorized  commentary   on the code  as well as the full text   that s the  recommended version   unfortunately  there s no handbook for  the abridged edition   and the full handbook is expensive     us    plus shipping and handling   subject  what is the cec   where can i get a copy    the canadian standards association is an organization made up  of various government agencies  power utilities  insurance  companies  electrical manufacturers and other organizations   the csa publishes csa standard c     which is updated every two  or three years   each province adopts  with some amendments   this standard and publishes a province specific code book   since each province publishes its own slightly modified  standard  it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa  standard itself   in this faq   cec  really means the  appropriate provincial standard   in particular  this faq is  derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code    th  edition          which is in turn based on csa c             th  edition    while differences exist between the provinces  an  attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail    the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical  inspection offices of your provincial power authority   in  ontario  it s ontario hydro   the ontario hydro book isn t  overly fat   it s about c     and includes mailed updates   i  hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the  equivalent nec publications    don t bother asking in quebec   diy wiring is banned throughout  the province   subject  can i do my own wiring   extra pointers    in most places  homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring   in some  they re not   check with your local electrical  inspector   most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s  homes for money without a license   nor are you permitted to do  wiring in  commercial  buildings   multiple dwellings  eg  duplexes   are usually considered  semi commercial  or  commercial    however   many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial  wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician   if you can  find one willing to supervise    if you do your own wiring  an important point    do it neat and well   what you really want to aim for is a better  job than an electrician will do   after all  it s your own home   and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make  a mistake   an electrician has time pressures  has the skills  and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast  safe job   in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that  are in excess of code  because we feel that it s reasonable   and will impress the inspector    the inspector will know that you re an amateur   you have to  earn his trust   the best way of doing this is to spend your  time doing as neat a job as possible   don t cut corners   exceed specifications   otherwise  the inspector may get extremely  picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions    don t try to hide anything from the inspector    use the proper tools   ie  don t use a bread knife to strip  wires  or twist wires with your fingers   the inspector  won t like it  and the results won t be that safe   and it  takes longer   and you re more likely to stick a hunk of    ga wire through your hand that way    don t handle house wire when it s very cold  eg  below    c  or   f    thermoplastic house wire  particularly older types  become very brittle   subject  what do i need in the way of tools    first  there s the obvious    a hammer  a drill  a few  screwdrivers  both straight and phillips head   if you re   lucky enough to live in canada  or find a source of csa approved  devices  you need robertson   square recess   screwdrivers      and     instead of phillips    for drilling a few holes  a      or    spade bit and      or       electric drill will do   if you re doing a lot  or  are working with elderly lumber  we recommend a      drill   right angle drills are wonderful   can be rented  and       or    screw point auger drill bits   these bits pull  you through  so they re much faster and less fatiguing  even  in    year old hardwood timbers    screw driver bits are useful for drills  expecially if you  install your electrical boxes using screws  drywall screws  work well      for stripping wire  use a real wire stripper  not a knife or  ordinary wire cutters   don t buy the    k mart  combo stripper   crimper and bottle opener  types   you should expect to pay      to     for a good  plier type  pair   it will have sized  stripping holes  and won t nick or grab the wire   it should  be easy to strip wire with it   one model has a small hole in the  blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals   there  are fancier types  autostrip cut   but they generally aren t  necessary  and pros usually don t use them    a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends  in constricted places   don t use these for stripping wire    you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts    you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling  inside boxes and closing loops  but it s better to form wire  loops with a  loop former hole  on your wire stripper   more  accurate    if you re using non metallic cable  get a cable stripper for  removing the sheath   or  do what some pros do  they nick the  end of the sheath  grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers   and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a   zipper   and cut the sheath off   you shouldn t try to strip  the sheath with a knife point  because it s too easy to  slash the insulation on the conductors   apparently stanley  utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters  hooked blades   can be used to strip sheath  but there is still the possibility  that you ll gouge the conductors    for any substantial amount of work with armored cable  it s well  worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter   us        hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire  or the insulation    three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired  outlets   about      multimeters tell you more  but are a lot more  expensive  and probably not worth it for most people   a simple  voltage sensor  which can detect potential through an insulated  wire not supplying any devices  is extremely helpful  they cost  about us     at radio shack    you should have a voltage detector   to check that the wires are  dead before doing work on them   neon bulb version are cheap         and work well   if you get more serious  a  audible alarm  type is  good for tracing circuits without a helper    though i ve been known  to lock the drill on  and hit breakers until the scream stops       for running wires through existing walls  you need fish tape   often  two tapes are needed  though sometimes  a bent hanger or  a length of thin chain will suffice   fish tapes can be rented    electrical tape   lots of it      seriously  a good and competent  wiring job will need very little tape   the tape is useful for  wrapping dicy insulation in repair work   another use is to wrap   around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination  screws   i don t do this  but drywall contractors prefer it  to  prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet  that has no cover plate    subject  what is ul listing    the ul stands for  underwriters laboratory    it used to be  an insurance industry organization  but now it is independent  and non profit   it tests electrical components and equipment  for potential hazards   when something is ul listed  that means  that the ul has tested the device  and it meets their requirements  for safety   ie  fire or shock hazard   it doesn t necessarily  mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to  just  that it probably won t kill you    the ul does not have power of law in the u s     you are  permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices   however   insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will  limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to  the failure of a non ul listed device   furthermore  in  many situations the nec will require that a wiring component  used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose   indirectly  this means that certain parts of your wiring  must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or  occupancy permits issued    subject  what is csa approval    every electrical device or component must be certified by the  canadian standards association before it can be sold in  canada   implicit in this is that all wiring must be done  with csa approved materials   they perform testing similar to  the ul  a bit more stringent   except that csa approval is  required by law    again  like the ul  if a fire was caused by non csa approved  equipment  your insurance company may not have to pay the  claim    in canada  there is a branch organization of the ul  called ulc   ul of canada    ulc does not have power of law  and seems to  be more a liason group between the csa and insurance  companies   subject  are there any cheaper  easier to read books on wiring    usa  the following three books were suggested by our readers       residential wiring      by jeff markell       craftsman books       carlsbad ca for         isbn                      practical electrical wiring      residential  farm and industrial   based on the national      electrical code    ansi nfpa         herbert p  richter and w  creighton schwan      mcgraw hill book co        wiring simplified      h  p  richter and w  c  schwan      park publishing co     try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec  revision   which is currently         canada  p s  knight authors and publishes a book called   electrical code simplified    there appears to be a version  published specific to each province  and is very tied into the  appropriate provincial code   it focuses on residential wiring   and is indispensible for canadian diy ers   it is better to get  this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring  or answer  questions on the net        it is updated each time the provincial codes are   this book is  available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c      subject  inspections how and what   why should i get my wiring inspected    most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and  inspections of any wiring that is done   amongst other more  mundane bureaucratic reasons  like insurance companies not  liking to have to pay claims   a permit and inspections  provides some assurance that you  your family  your neighbors  or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose  their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job    most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your  home  or order you to tear out any wiring done without a  permit   california  for instance  is particularly nasty about  this    if fire starts in your home  and un inspected wiring is at  fault  insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage  claims    in general  the process goes like this      you apply to your local inspections office or building     department for a permit   you should have a sketch or     detailed drawing of what you plan on doing   this is     a good time to ask questions on any things you re not     sure of   if you re doing major work  they may impose     special conditions on you  require loading     calculations and ask other questions   at this point     they will tell you which inspections you will need      if you re installing a main panel  you will need to     have the panel and service connections inspected     before your power utility will provide a connection      this is sometimes done by the local power authority     rather than the usual inspectors      after installing the boxes and wiring  but before     the insulation walls go up  you will need a      rough in  inspection      after the walls are up  and the wiring is complete      you will need a  final inspection    subject  my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations   do i have to upgrade    in general  there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings   though there are some exceptions  ie  smoke detectors in some  cases    however  any new work must be done according to the  latest electrical code   also  if you do   major   work  you  may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all  of your system   check with your local electrical inspector   subject  a word on voltages                                one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the  different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of  a circuit   one person might talk about    v  another    v  or another    v   these are all  in fact  exactly the same  thing     in north america the utility companies are required  to supply a split phase     volt        feed to your house   this works out as two    v       legs   additionally  since there  are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring  it s not  unreasonable to find    v has dropped to    v or    v has dropped  to    v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet   especially  at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run   for a number  of reasons  some historical  some simple personal orneryness   different people choose call them by slightly different numbers   this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them     v  and      v   except when actually saying what the measured voltage will  be   confusing   a bit   just ignore it    one thing that might make this a little more understandable  is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower  ie     v  instead of    v  value   what this implies is that the device  is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that  low       v is  not  the same as    v      v is the voltage between  phases of a   phase  y  circuit that is    v from neutral to any  hot       v is the voltage between phases of a   phase  y   circuit that s    v from hot to neutral    in keeping with    v versus    v strangeness  motors intended  to run on    v three phase are often labelled as    v     subject  what does an electrical service look like    there are logically four wires involved with supplying the  main panel with power   three of them will come from the utility  pole  and a fourth  bare  wire comes from elsewhere     the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded   into the ground  or to a wire buried in the foundation  or sometimes   to the water supply pipe  has to be metal  continuous to where  the main water pipe entering the house   watch out for galvanic  action conductivity  breaks   often between copper and iron pipe     this is the  grounding conductor    it is there to make sure that  the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground   this wire  normally carries no current    one of the other wires will be white  or black with white or  yellow stripes  or sometimes simply black    it is the neutral wire   it is connected to the  centre tap   cec   center tap  in the  nec  of the distribution transformer supplying the power   it  is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place  often  inside the panel    the neutral and ground should not be connected  anywhere else   otherwise  weird and or dangerous things may happen    furthermore  there should only be one grounding system in  a home   some codes require more than one grounding electrode   these will be connected together  or connected to the neutral  at a common point   still one grounding system   adding additional  grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house  wiring is unsafe and contrary to code    if you add a subpanel  the ground and neutral are usually  brought as separate conductors from the main panel  and are  not connected together in the subpanel  ie  still only one  neutral ground connection    however  in some situations    certain categories of separate buildings  you actually do  have to provide a second grounding electrode   consult your  inspector    the other two wires will usually be black  and are the  hot   wires   they are attached to the distribution transformer as  well    the two black wires are     degrees out of phase with each  other   this means if you connect something to both hot wires   the voltage will be     volts   if you connect something to the  white and either of the two blacks you will get    v    some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them   this is either because the neutral and ground are connected  together at a different point  eg  the meter or pole  and one  wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground  or in some  rare occasions  the service has only one hot wire     v only  service    subject  what is a circuit    inside the panel  connections are made to the incoming wires   these connections are then used to supply power to selected  portions of the home   there are three different combinations       one hot  one neutral  and ground     v circuit       two hots  no neutral  and ground     v circuit       two hots  neutral  and ground     v circuit   neutral       and or two    v circuits with a common neutral        is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and  lighting within your house       is usually used for supplying  power to major appliances such as stoves  and dryers   they  often have need for both    v and    v  or for bringing several  circuits from the panel box to a distribution point       is  usually for special    v motor circuits  electric heaters  or  air conditioners     note  in the us  the nec frequently permits a circuit similar  to     be used for stoves and dryers   namely  that there  are two hot wires  and a wire that does dual duty as neutral  and ground  and is connected to the frame as well as providing  the neutral for    v purposes   three prong plugs instead  of four   only  for stoves dryers connected to the main panel   when connected to most sub panels    prong plugs and receptacles  are required    in our not so humble opinion this is crazy  but  the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the      nec   and found to be safe   check your local codes  or inquire as to  local practice    there are restrictions on when this is  permissible         is usually wired with three conductor wire  black for hot   white for neutral  and bare for grounding        and     have one hot wire coloured red  the other black  a  bare wire for grounding  and in     a white wire for neutral    you will sometimes see     wired with just a black  white and ground  wire   since the white is  hot  in this case  both the nec and cec  requires that the white wire be  permanently marked  at the ends  to indicate that it is a live wire   usually done with paint  nail  polish or sometimes electrical tape    each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the  panel through a circuit breaker or fuse    there are  in a few locales  circuits that look like           or     except that they have two bare ground wires   some places  require this for hot tubs and the like  one ground is  frame ground    the other attaches to the motor    this may or may not be an  alternative to gfci protection   subject   grounding  versus  grounded  versus  neutral     according to the terminology in the cec and nec  the   grounding  conductor is for the safety ground  i e   the green  or bare wire   the word  neutral  is reserved for the white when  you have a circuit with more than one  hot  wire   since the white  wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the  panel  the proper term is  grounded conductor    however  the  potential confusion between  grounded conductor  and  grounding  conductor  can lead to potentially lethal mistakes   you should  never use the bare wire as a  grounded conductor  or white wire  as the  grounding conductor   even though they are connected  together in the panel     but not in subpanels   subpanels are fed neutral and ground  separately from the main panel   usually     in the trade  and in common usage  the word  neutral  is used  for  grounded conductor    this faq uses  neutral  simply to  avoid potential confusion   we recommend that you use  neutral   too   thus the white wire is always  except in some light  switch applications  neutral   not ground   subject  what does a fuse or breaker do   what are the differences    fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power  to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels   for  example  if your toaster shorts out  a fuse or breaker should   trip   protecting the wiring in the walls from melting   as  such  fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the  wiring    ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the  equipment itself won t cause a fire    fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt   safely  when the current exceeds the rated value  thereby  interrupting the power to the circuit   fuses trip relatively  fast   which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have  large startup current surges   for motor circuits  you can use  a  time delay  fuse  one brand is  fusetron   which will avoid  tripping on momentary overloads   a fusetron looks like a  spring loaded fuse   a fuse can only trip once  then it must be  replaced    breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices   they  usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched  into position against another contact   when the current flow  through the device exceeds the rated value  a bimetallic strip  heats up and bends   by bending it  trips  the latch  and the  spring pulls the contacts apart   circuit breakers behave  similarly to fusetrons   that is  they tend to take longer to  trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses   with high  overloads  they trip quickly   breakers can be reset a finite  number of times   each time they trip  or are thrown  when the circuit is in use  some arcing takes place  which  damages the contacts   thus  breakers should not be used in  place of switches unless they are specially listed for the  purpose    neither fuses nor breakers  limit  the current per se   a dead  short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even  thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time  which  can often cause severe damage   subject  breakers   can t i use fuses    statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher  risk of causing a fire than breaker panels   this is usually  due to the fuse being loosely screwed in  or the contacts  corroding and heating up over time  or the wrong size fuse  being installed  or the proverbial  replace the fuse with a  penny  trick    since breakers are more permanently installed  and have better  connection mechanisms  the risk of fire is considerably less    fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload   when  a fuse explodes  the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting  path   result  from complete meltdown of the electrical panel   melted service wiring  through fires in the electrical  distribution transformer and having your house burn down   breakers don t do this    many jurisdictions  particularly in canada  no longer permit  fuse panels in new installations   the nec does permit new  fuse panels in some rare circumstances  requiring the special  inserts to  key  the fuseholder to specific size fuses    some devices  notably certain large air conditioners  require fuse  protection in addition to the breaker at the panel   the fuse  is there to protect the motor windings from overload   check the  labeling on the unit   this is usually only on large permanently  installed motors   the installation instructions will tell you  if you need one   subject  what size wire should i use    for a    amp circuit  use    gauge wire   for a    amp circuit   you can use    gauge wire  in most locales    for a long run   though  you should use the next larger size wire  to avoid  voltage drops      gauge is only slightly more expensive than     gauge  though it s stiffer and harder to work with    here s a quick table for normal situations   go up a size for  more than     foot runs  when the cable is in conduit  or  ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate  heat easily     gauge  amps                                               we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent  on the application and precise wire type   subject  where do these numbers come from    there are two considerations  voltage drop and heat buildup   the smaller the wire is  the higher the resistance is   when  the resistance is higher  the wire heats up more  and there is  more voltage drop in the wiring   the former is why you need  higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in  conduit  the latter is why you should use larger wire for long  runs    neither effect is very significant over very short distances   there are some very specific exceptions  where use of smaller  wire is allowed   the obvious one is the line cord on most  lamps   don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits  one of those exceptions  you can never go wrong by using larger  wire   subject  what does        mean    this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors  in a cable   the first number specifies the gauge   the second  the number of current carrying conductors in the wire   but  remember there s usually an extra ground wire          means     gauge  two insulated current carrying wires  plus bare ground       wire usually has a black  white and bare ground wire   sometimes  the white is red instead for    v circuits without neutral   in  the latter case  the sheath is usually red too       wire usually has a black  red  white and bare ground wire   usually carrying    v with neutral   subject  what is a  wirenut   marrette   marr connector    how are they  used    a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used  to connect wires together    marrette  or  marr connector   are trade names   you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring    in essence  you strip the end of the wires about an inch  twist them  together  then twist the wirenut on    though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the  wire  do it anyways   it s more mechanically and electrically  secure    there are many different sizes of wire nut   you should check  that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the  quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together    don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or  your fingers   use a pair of blunt nose   linesman   pliers   and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly   sometimes  it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it  goes in the wirenut properly    some people wrap the  open  end of the wirenut with electrical  tape   this is probably not a good idea   the inspector may  tear it off during an inspection   it s usually done because  a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut   instead  of taping it  the connection should be redone   subject  what is a gfi gfci    a gfci is a   ground fault circuit interrupter     it measures  the current current flowing through the hot wire and the  neutral wire   if they differ by more than a few milliamps  the  presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other  path   this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of  an appliance  or to the ground lead  or through a person   any  of these situations is hazardous  so the gfci trips  breaking  the circuit    gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks   if   for example  you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral  leads of a circuit  and no part of you was grounded  a gfci  wouldn t help   all of the current that passed from the hot  lead into you would return via the neutral lead  keeping the  gfci happy    the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric   one is labeled load  the other  line   the incoming power feed   must  be connected to the line side  or the outlet will not be  protected   the load side can be used to protect all devices  downstream from it   thus  a whole string of outlets can be  covered by a single gfci outlet   subject  where should gfcis be used    the nec mandates gfcis for    v    a or   a single phase  outlets  in bathrooms  kitchens within    of the sink  garages   unfinished basements or crawl spaces  outdoors  near a pool  or  just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water  or dampness   there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets   those dedicated to appliances   occupying fixed space     typically refrigerators and freezers  and for sump pumps and  laundry appliances    the cec does not mandate as many gfcis   in particular  there  is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets  or most garage or  basement outlets   basement outlets must be protected if you  have a dirt floor  garage outlets if they re near the door to  outside   bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis    even if you are not required to have gfci protection  you may  want to consider installing it anyway   unless you need a gfci  breaker  see below   the cost is low   in the u s   gfci  outlets can cost as little as us      costs are a bit higher in  canada   c       evaluate your own risk factors   does your  finished basement ever get wet   do you have small children   do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools   does  water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage   subject  where shouldn t i use a gfci    gfcis are generally not used on circuits that  a  don t pose a  safety risk  and  b  are used to power equipment that must run  unattended for long periods of time   refrigerators  freezers   and sump pumps are good examples   the rationale is that gfcis  are sometimes prone to nuisance trips   some people claim that  the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary  current imbalance  tripping the gfci   note  though  that most  gfci trips are real  if you re getting a lot of trips for no  apparent reason  you d be well advised to check your wiring  before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless   subject  what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker    for most situations  you can use either a gfci outlet as the  first device on the circuit  or you can install a breaker with  a built in gfci   the former is generally preferred  since gfci  breakers are quite expensive   for example  an ordinary ge  breaker costs  us    the gfci model costs  us      there is one  major exception   if you need to protect a   multi wire branch  circuit    two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire    such as a canadian style kitchen circuit  you ll need a  multi pole gfci breaker   unfortunately  these are expensive   the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars  depending on  what brand of panel box you have   but if you must protect such  a circuit  say  for a pool heater   you have no choice    one more caveat    gfci outlets are bulky   you may want to use  an oversize box when installing them   on second thought  use  large  actually deep  boxes everywhere   you ll thank yourself for it    incidentally  if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one  specific outlet is protected  such as a bathroom   you don t  really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first  outlet in the circuit  you could simply find the first outlet  in the bathroom  and not gfci anything upstream of it   but  protecting the whole circuit is preferred    when you install a gfci  it s a good idea to use the little   ground fault protected  stickers that come with it and mark  the outlets downstream of the gfci   you can figure out which  outlets are  downstream   simply by tripping the gfci with the  test button and see which outlets are dead   subject  what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet  then    apart from their use in electronics  which we won t comment on   and for certain fluorescent lights  they won t turn on without  a good ground connection   they re intended to guard against  insulation failures within the device   generally  the case of  the appliance is connected to the ground lead   if there s an  insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case  the  ground lead conducts the electricity away safely  and possibly  trips the circuit breaker in the process    if the case is not  grounded and such a short occurs  the case is live    and if  you touch it while you re grounded  you ll get zapped   of  course  if the circuit is gfci protected  it will be a very  tiny zap    which is why you can use gfcis to replace  ungrounded outlets  both nec and cec     there are some appliances that should  never  be grounded   in  particular  that applies to toasters and anything else with  exposed conductors   consider   if you touch the heating  electrode in a toaster  and you re not grounded  nothing will  happen   if you re slightly grounded  you ll get a small shock   the resistance will be too high   but if the case were  grounded  and you were holding it  you d be the perfect path to  ground     subject  why is one prong wider than the other   polarization   nowadays  many two prong devices have one prong wider than the  other   this is so that the device could rely  not guaranteed    on one specific wire being neutral  and the other hot   this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures  where the  the shell should neutral  safety   or other devices which want to  have an approximate ground reference  ie  some radios     most   prong extension cords have wide prongs too    this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right  way around   you want the wide prong to be neutral  and the  narrow one hot   most outlets have a darker metal for the  hot screw  and lighter coloured screw for the neutral   if not  you can usually figure out which is which by which  prong the terminating screw connects to   subject  what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen    the nec requires at least two    amp   small appliance  circuits   for kitchens   the cec requires split duplex  receptacles   outlets must be installed such that no point is more  than      nec       mm cec  from an outlet   every counter wider  than      nec  or     mm  cec  must have at least one outlet   the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except  in the kitchen  pantry  or dining room   furthermore  these circuits  are in addition to any required for refrigerators  stoves  microwaves   lighting  etc   non dedicated outlets within    of a sink  must  be  protected by a gfci  nec only     split duplex receptacles are fed with a    v circuit   the tab  is broken on the hot side of the outlet  and one hot goes to  the upper outlet  and the other hot goes to the lower outlet   the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw   when   carrying through  to another outlet  the neutral must be  pigtailed  such that removing the outlet  or having the neutral  connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect  from downstream outlets   subject  where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms    there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom  adjacent to  the sink  in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in  the light fixture   all such outlets  must  be gfci protected   subject  what is romex nm nmd   what is bx   when should i use each    romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire   sometimes called non metallic sheath   the formal name is nm   this is suitable for use in dry  protected areas  ie  inside  stud walls  on the sides of joists etc    that are not subject  to mechanical damage or excessive heat   most newer homes are  wired almost exclusively with nm wire   there are several  different categories of nm cable    bx cable    technically known as armored cable or  ac  has a  flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is  fairly resistant to damage    teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic  sheath     protection for cable in concealed locations  where nm or ac cable  is run through studs  joists or similar wooden members  the outer  surface of the cable must be kept at least   mm        cec   nec   from the edges of the wooden members  or the cable should be protected  from mechanical injury   this latter protection can take the form of  metal plates  such as spare outlet box ends  or conduit     note  inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored  cable  or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection   but this is technically illegal     additional protection recommendations  these are rules in the  canadian codes   they are reasonable answers to the vague  references to  exposed to mechanical damage  in both the nec  and cec           nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage        where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls        in exposed locations under   feet from the floor         ie  use ac instead  flexible conduit  wooden guards etc         where cable is suspended  as in  connections to furnaces        or water heaters  the wire should be protected   canadian        practise is usually to install a junction or outlet        box on the wall  and use a short length of ac cable        or nm cable in flexible conduit to  jump  to the appliance         stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used         where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating        ducts or pipe  heat transfer should be minimized by        means of a   mm    air space  or suitable insulation        material  a wad of fiberglass          nm cable shall be supported within    mm    of every box        or fitting  and at intervals of no more than    m            holes in joists or studs are considered  supports          some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to        each box    while fishing cable is technically in violation         it is permitted where  proper  support is impractical           conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge          knight also insists on only one cable per staple  referring        to the  workmanship  clause  but this seems more honoured        in the breach            cable should never be buried in plaster  cement or        similar finish         cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards         cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists        or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more        than  m          whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp  small  plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to  prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through  the insulation    bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by  solid wall coverings    in places where damage is more likely  like on the back wall of  a garage      you may be required to use conduit  a  ul   or csa   approved metal pipe   you use various types of  fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the  wire    service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit    in damp places  eg  buried wiring to outdoor lighting  you will  need special wire  eg  cec nmw    nec uf    nmw   looks like  very heavy duty nmd     you will usually need short lengths of  conduit where the wire enters exits the ground    see underground  wiring section      thermoplastic sheath wire  such as nm  nmw etc   should not be   exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that   purpose    many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through  furnace ducts  including cold air return plenums constructed  by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces    the reason for this  is that if there s a fire  the ducting will spread toxic gasses  from burning insulation very rapidly through the building   teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas      canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us    except that canadian wire designations usually include the   temperature rating in celsius   eg   ac    versus  ac    in the us  nm b is    degrees celcius    note  local codes vary   this is one of the items that changes  most often   eg  chicago codes require conduit  everywhere    there are very different requirements for mobile homes   check your local codes   especially  if you re doing anything  that s the slightest out of the ordinary    wire selection table  incomplete   the real tables are enormous   uncommon wire types or applications omitted    condition   type cec nec   exposed concealed dry  plastic nmd   nm      armor ac   ac       teck     exposed

boxes    the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable  only   the reasoning is simple    with armored cable  the box  itself provides ground conductor continuity   u s  plastic  boxes don t use metal cable clamps    the cec is slightly different   the cec never permits cable  armor as a grounding conductor   however  you must still  provide ground continuity for metallic sheath   the cec also  requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes    the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for  non metallic sheathed cable    you can avoid making one ground  connection and they sometimes cost a little less   on the other  hand  plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts   for  exposed or shop wiring  metal boxes are probably better   subject  junction box positioning    a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together    junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible  later   ie  not buried under plaster   excessive use of junction  boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation  and inspectors may  get nasty   subject  can i install a replacement light fixture    in general  one can replace fixtures freely  subject to a few  caveats   first  of course  one should check the amperage  rating of the circuit   if your heart is set on installing half  a dozen     watt floodlights  you may need to run a new wire  back to the panel box   but there are some more subtle  constraints as well   for example  older house  wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation   the excess  heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the  insulation to deteriorate and crack  with obvious bad results   some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high  temperature wire only    you may find  in fact  that your  ceiling wiring already has this problem  in which case  replacing any devices is a real adventure     other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some  fluorescent fixtures  and making sure that the ceiling box and  its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy  chandelier or ceiling fan   you may need to install a new box  specifically listed for this purpose   a  x  across the ceiling  joists makes a good support   metal brackets are also available  that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and  mounted between the joists    there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as   pot  lamps or heat lamps   when these are installed in insulated  ceilings  they can present a very substantial fire hazard   the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated  ceilings  provided that the fixture is boxed in a  coffin   usually    x   x      made by making a pair of joists     high  and covering  with plywood  that doesn t have any insulation    yes  that s    feet   long    nec rules are somewhat less stringent   they require at least     clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation   the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement   which means that a cec style   coffin   might be worthwhile   presumably  that s up to the local inspector    the cec doesn t  actually mandate the coffin per se  this seems to be an inspector  requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get  accidentally buried in insulation   ie  if you have insulation blown  in later     there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and  fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation   they are  usually limited to    watt bulbs  and are unfortunately  somewhat  more expensive than the older types   before you use them  you should  ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses   follow the installation instructions carefully  the prescribed location  for the sensor can vary    there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved  for use in insulation   the  coffin  appears the only legal approach   subject  what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts    this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is  loose   depending on the load balance  one hot wire may end up  being more than    v  and the other less than    v  with  respect to ground   this is a very hazardous situation   it can  destroy your electronic equipment  possibly start fires  and in  some situations electrocute you  ie  some us jurisdictions  require the stove frame connected to neutral     if this happens  contact your electrical authority immediately  and have them come and check out the problem    note  a brief      second  brightening is sometimes normal with  lighting and motors on the same    v with neutral circuit   a  loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness  far longer than one second   in case of doubt  get help   subject  what is   phase power   should i use it   can i get it in my house    three phase power has three  hot  wires      degrees out of  phase with each other   these are usually used for large motors  because it is more  efficient   provides a bit more starting torque   and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper    you re most likely to encounter a   phase circuit that shows      volts between any hot and ground  and     volts between  any two hots   the latter shows the difference between a normal     v    v common neutral circuit  which is     volts between the  two hots   there are   phase circuits with different voltages    bringing in a   phase feed to your house is usually  ridiculously expensive  or impossible   if the equipment you  want to run has a standard motor mount  it is  much  cheaper to  buy a new    v or    v motor for it   in some cases it is  possible to run   phase equipment on ordinary power if you have  a  capacitor start  unit  or use a larger motor as a   auto  generator   these are tricky  but are a good solution if  the motor is non standard size  or too expensive or too big to  replace   the taunton press book   the small shop   has an  article on how to do this if you must    note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using  such a converter   the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that   subject  is it better to run motors at     or        theoretically  it doesn t make any difference   however  there  is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply  wiring   all things being equal  a    v motor will lose   times  less power in the house wiring than a    v motor   this also  means that the startup surge loss will be less  and the motor  will get to speed quicker   and in some circumstances  the  smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life    this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more  than    feet long   subject  what is this nonsense about  hp on    v   a circuits    it is a universal physical law that   hp is equal to      watts   given heating loss  power factor and other inefficiencies   it is usually best to consider   hp is going to need            watts   a    v   a circuit can only deliver      watts to a motor   so it cannot possibly be more than approximately   hp   given rational  efficiency factors     hp is more like it    some equipment manufacturers  sears in particular  most router  manufacturers in general     advertise a hp rating that is far  in excess of what is possible   they are giving you a  stall  horsepower  or similar   that means the power is measured when  the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load   what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that  condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker  will trip  otherwise the motor will melt    it s drawing far  more current than it can continuously    when comparing motors  compare the continuous horsepower   this  should be on the motor nameplate   if you can t find that figure   check the amperage rating  which is always present   subject  how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong    older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead  of the more modern three   these receptacles have no safety  ground  and the cabling usually has no ground wire   neither  the nec or cec permits installing new   prong receptacles anymore    there are several different approaches to solving this          if the wiring is done through conduit or bx  and the         conduit is continuous back to the panel  you can connect         the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle         box   nec mainly   cec frowns on this practise          if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby  and         it s continuous to the main house ground point  you can         run a conductor to it from the third prong          run a ground conductor back to the main panel          easiest  install a gfci receptacle   the ground lug         should not be connected to anything  but the gfci         protection itself will serve instead   the gfci         will also protect downstream  possibly also two prong         outlets    if you do this to protect downstream outlets          the grounds must not be connected together   since it         wouldn t be connected to a real ground  a wiring fault         could energize the cases of   prong devices connected         to other outlets   be sure  though  that there aren t         indirect ground plug connections  such as via the sheath         on bx cable    the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three  prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop   like caulking compound   this is not permitted in the nec   subject  are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets   should the test button work    we re sure about what the nec and cec say   remember  though   that your local codes may vary   as for the test button    there s  a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line  side of the neutral wire when you press the test button   current  through this resistor shows up as an imbalance  and trips the gfci   this is a simple  passive  and reliable test  and doesn t require  a real ground to work   if your gfci does not trip when you press  the test button  it is very probably defective or miswired   again   if the test button doesn t work  something s broken  and potentially  dangerous   the problem should be corrected immediately    the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground  wire must be connected   we do not know why they say this   the  causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet  or with the  formalities of ul or csa listing    perhaps the device was never  tested without the ground wire being connected   on the other hand   ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device  behaves properly in  all  listed applications  including ungrounded  outlet replacement    one of us called leviton  their gfcis are  labeled for installation on grounded circuits only   the technician  was surprised to see that  he agreed that the nec does not require  it  and promised to investigate    subject  how should i wire my shop    as with any other kind of wiring  you need enough power for all  devices that will be on simultaneously   the code specifies  that you should stay under     of the nominal capacity of the  circuit   for typical home shop use  this means one circuit for  the major power tools  and possibly one for a dust collector or  shop vac   use at least    gauge wire    many power tools have  big motors  with a big start up surge   if you can  use    amp  breakers  nec   though cec requires standard   a receptacles  which means you d have to  replug  all your equipment   lights  should either be on a circuit of their own    and not shared  with circuits in the rest of the house    or be on at least two  separate circuits   the idea is that you want to avoid a  situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand  rpm  while you re groping in the dark for the off switch    do install lots of outlets   it s easier to install them in the  beginning  when you don t have to cut into an existing cable   it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each  point  so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same  time as the tool you really want   but use metal boxes and  plates  and maybe even metal sheathed cable  you may have  objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit  wrong    note that some jurisdictions have a  no horizontal wiring   rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used  for working   what this means is that all wiring must be  run along structural members   ie  stapled to studs    other possible shop circuits include heater circuits     v  circuits for some large tools  and air compressor circuits   don t overload circuits  and don t use extension cords if you  can help it  unless they re rated for high currents    a coiled  extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of  the same gauge   also  the insulation won t withstand as much  heat  and heat dissipation is the critical issue     if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel   you should probably install a subpanel  and derive your shop  wiring from it   if you have young children  you may want to  equip this panel with a cut off switch  and possibly a lock   if you want to install individual switches to   safe    particular circuits  make sure you get ones rated high enough   for example  ordinary light switches are not safely able to  handle the start up surge generated by a table saw   buy    horsepower rated   switches instead    finally  note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished  basements  hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply   and  even if you   know   that you d never use one of your shop  outlets to run a lawn mower  the next owner of your house might  have a different idea    note  fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop  wiring   april      is one place to start   subject  underground wiring   you will need to prepare a trench to specifications  use  special wire  protect the wire with conduit or special plastic  tubing and possibly lumber  don t use creosoted lumber  it rots  thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion  of lead    the transition from in house to underground wire is  generally via conduit   all outdoor boxes must be specifically  listed for the purpose  and contain the appropriate gaskets   fittings  etc   if the location of the box is subject to immersion  in water  a more serious style of water proof box is needed   and  of course  don t forget the gfcis    the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction  so we suggest you consult your inspector about  your specific situation    a hint  buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says  buried power  line  and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed   subject  aluminum wiring   during the      s  aluminum  instead of copper  wiring became  quite popular and was extensively used   since that time   aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires   and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations   we recommend  even if you re allowed to  that do not use it for new  wiring    but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring   aluminum  wiring  when properly installed  can be just as safe as copper   aluminum wiring is  however  very unforgiving of improper  installation   we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential  problems  and what you can do to make your wiring safe    the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as   cold creep    when aluminum wiring warms up  it expands   when  it cools down  it contracts   unlike copper  when aluminum goes  through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each  time   to make the problem worse  aluminum oxidises  or corrodes  when in contact with certain types of metal  so the resistance  of the connection goes up   which causes it to heat up and corrode   oxidize still more   eventually the wire may start getting very hot   melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to  and possibly even  cause a fire    since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move  into a house built during the    s  we will cover basic points of  safe aluminum wiring   we suggest that  if you re considering purchasing  a home with aluminum wiring  or have discovered it later  that you  hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring  for the following things           fixtures  eg  outlets and switches  directly attached to         aluminum wiring should be rated for it   the device will         be stamped with  al cu  or  co alr    the latter supersedes         the former  but both are safe    these fixtures are somewhat         more expensive than the ordinary ones           wires should be properly connected  at least     way around         the screw in a clockwise direction    connections should be         tight   while repeated tightening of the screws can make the         problem worse  during the inspection it would pay off to snug         up each connection           note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the         main service entrance cable   it should be inspected            push in  terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire          any connections using push in terminals should be redone with         the proper screw connections immediately           there should be no signs of overheating  darkened connections          melted insulation  or  baked  fixtures   any such damage should         be repaired                connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be         handled specially   current canadian codes require that the         wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting         aluminum to copper   the nec requires that the wire be         connected together using special crimp devices  with an         anti oxidant grease   the tools and materials for the latter         are quite expensive   not practical to do it yourself unless         you can rent the tool           any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring         by means of a short copper  pigtail    see     above                shows reasonable workmanship  neat wiring  properly stripped          not nicked  wire etc        if  when considering purchasing a home  an inspection of the wiring  shows no problems or only one or two  we believe that you can

it s generally a good idea to hire  an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas   not just for wiring  but plumbing and structural as well   if an  inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor  ones  we believe that you can consider the wiring safe  after any  minor problems are fixed    if there are signs of problems in many  places  we suggest you look elsewhere    here s some hints on what to look for    obvious non code wiring can include       zip cord wiring  either concealed or nailed to walls     hot wiring on the identified  neutral

unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines   certain wiring practises that are actually to code  or were at one  time  sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations       switches

except when     it s  really  convenient         switches and outlets in bizarre locations     great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps     junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them     wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or     ceiling     backwrapped grounding wires  subject  what is this weird stuff   old style wiring    in the years since edison  invented  electricity  several different  wiring  styles  have come and gone   when you buy an older home you  may encounter some of this stuff   this section describes the old   methods  and some of their idiosyncrasies    the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called   knob and tube   k t    it is made up of individual conductors with  a cloth insulation   the wires are run along side structural  members  eg  joists or studs  using ceramic stand offs  knobs    wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes   connections  were made by twisting the wire together  soldering  and wrapping  with tape   since the hot and neutral were run separately   the wiring tends to be rather confusing   a neutral often runs  down the centre of each room  with  taps  off to each fixture   the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next   in some  cases k t isn t colour coded  so the neutral is often the same  colour as the hot wires    you ll see k t in homes built as late as the    s    comments on k t       the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about     electricity  so the workmanship tends to be pretty good      the wire  insulation and insulators tend to stand up     very well   most k t i ve seen  for example  is in     quite good condition      no grounding   grounding is usually difficult to install      boxes are small   receptacle replacement  particularly with     gfci  can be difficult   no bushing on boxes either      so wiring changes need special attention to box entry      sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between     separately hot circuits  so it is sometimes possible to     overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on     any circuit      building code does not permit insulation in walls     that contain k t      connection to existing k t from new circuits can be     tricky   consult your inspector      modern wiring practise requires considerably more     outlets to be installed than k t systems did     since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t  necessary to replace it simply because it s k t   what you should  watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and  be cautious about circuit loading   in many cases it s perfectly  reasonable to leave existing k t alone  and add new fixtures on  new circuits using modern techniques     after k t  they invented multi conductor cable   the first type  you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation   it looks  much like the romex cable of the last decade or two   this stuff was  used in the    s and    s   again  no grounding conductor   it was installed much like modern wiring   its major drawback  is that this type of insulation embrittles   we ve seen whole  systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at  a touch   bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems    this stuff is very fragile  and becomes rather hazardous if  the wires become bare   this wiring should be left untouched as  much as possible   whenever an opportunity arises  replace it   a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several  hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink  tubing    after this wiring technique  the more modern romex was invented   it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth   often a bit sticky   this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard  and is reasonably easy to work with   it does not need to be  replaced   it should be considered as safe as the  modern  stuff    thermoplastic insulation wire   just don t abuse it too much   subject  where do i buy stuff    try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you   their  prices will often be considerably better

amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing  if you open the amp up  there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well   perfect   symmetry for both channels and two transformers   one for each   channel   the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the classe model    ie  very good   i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east   or where ever   but if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed  you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant  i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with   those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly   hot   but that s how you get an

wrong   anyone else think so   back in the    s i was a service technician for a cash register company  the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise   the biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded   in almost every place we went to do an installation  we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral   for       of the things you can plug into one of these  they work fine   for our cash registers they were a nightmare    line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically   with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem   even the company i used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment   i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected   although not ideal  it should be o k  for most applications

direction    to further explain the situation  assume we are firing sonars a b c   ms apart each other  we should normally see an echo on a that corresponds to the distance  however  sonar a detects the init line of sonar b  the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a  we can see a very faint   khz signal on the transducer  exactly at the time the init line of sonar b is activated    we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference  we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars b and c    has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and this type of experience  your suggestions for remedies will be greatly appreciated        caglan m  aras                    aras eceris ece ncsu edu ece

section  could also be used at these speeds   there is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this  the mc      if i remember rightly      while using this would have let me reduce the  external  if count on receive  it didn t really offer all that much help on transmit so i didn t bother with it     the radios i built were first designed and built for     kbps in a   mhz channel but later reduced to half that   these     kbps radios actually have done quite well in across the bench tests at     kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design   handling the data stream

is a phd research project and i have to test  the chip at speed on a pcb  i expect to have roughly      packaged circuits and will do dc  low speed and high speed  testing using   different set ups for the test chip        i know for sure that a dip will not work   the long lead lines have too high an inductance    getting a custom made package is too expensive  so  i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a  leadless chip carrier  the flatpack would be hard  to test since it has to be soldered on to the test  setup and i would spend loads of time soldering   as i kept changing the test chip  the leadless chip  carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may  not work at high speeds       does anyone out there have experience knowledge  of this field   i would greatly appreciate

and we use dip s along with plcc s    mil and   mil pitch    pin qfp s to name a few   i don t see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices     a good source of information is motorola s mecl system design handbook  the latest ed  is dated        that is considered to be one of the  bibles  in high speed design   the very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you re most likely going to need a socket   it in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing  not to mention any impedance discontinuities   i don t see the big concern over the packaging because it probably isn t going to make that much difference  if you re trying to get ttl to run at    mhz  have fun    ttl was never designed to run in a    mhz

in the far east    or where ever   but if you look in the amp and see what components    they use and how it was designed  you can easily see why the    amplifiers sound so brilliant   good point   also  i wouldn t be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior quality   as long as it was properly designed and robust  premium components are used  it shouldn t matter where it is assembled    i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with    those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly    hot   but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good   an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound  the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day   actually  i d be wary of excessively hot amps   cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way  excessive  heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component regardless of quality   in fact  an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs   hmmmmm      aaron     newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from

signal of the radio tape unit is before it   gets amplified  because then couldn t i hook up rca outputs to that signal   so then he could just use a little amplifier    well  one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips   use a probe with a   m resistor  like a scope probe  connected to the input of a small audio amp w speaker   if you find line level input to both chips  one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily     if you want to pick off a near line level signal  suitable for feeding to an outboard amp  the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough   this is  before  the volume control  and usually before the tone and balance controls too    if you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot  this will be after the volume control  but again  probably  before the other controls      if the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip  you should probably forget the whole

massive concrete cylinders that  are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders  that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the  actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called   cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool   except for their size  the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the      s  a hundred years ago  for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways   basicly  the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower     of the tower  to assist cooling and the draft  water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes  the cold water evaporates  removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft  this produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers   that slight pinch  maybe     of the way up the tower  is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced  compared to a straight cylinder shape   the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again  the wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference  sometimes as high as      degrees or more from first stage  hot  turbine to final stage  cold  turbine

wrote     i really don t know where to post this question so i figured that    this board would be most appropriate     i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that    are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders    that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the    actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called     cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool        except for their size  the cooling towers on nuclear power plants   are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling   towers designed and built in the      s  a hundred years ago  for   coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways        basicly  the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when   its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network   of pipes that fill about the lower     of the tower  to assist cooling   and the draft  water misters are added that spray cold water over the   hot pipes  the cold water evaporates  removing the heat faster than   just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is   rapidly carried away by the draft  this produces the clouds frequently   seen rising out of these towers        that slight pinch  maybe     of the way up the tower  is there because   it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of   the air draft produced  compared to a straight cylinder shape        the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam   system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the   boiler and used again  the wider the temperature difference across   the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and   by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it   back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference    sometimes as high as      degrees or more from first stage  hot    turbine to final stage  cold  turbine

grounding power wiring  was re  a question about    vac outlet wiring  there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here   a few points need to be clarified   the equipment grounding conductor  green  green with a yellow stripe  bare  or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods  is used as a safety ground  to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel  and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects   it should never  except for a few exceptions to be discussed later  carry the normal operating current of a connected load   some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor     much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor  and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation    orange  outlets are often used for this  with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box  and in many cases back to the service   anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems   the code requires the insulated grounding conductors  green wires  to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box  and  if required  back all the way to the service entrance   where it is bonded to the service ground  water pipe or rod   many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely  where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either    the grounded conductor of a circuit  often called the neutral  which is referred to in the code as the  identified  conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey   this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point  generally at the service entrance panel   this connection is through the main bonding jumper    in many household service panels  the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel     the grounded conductor  neutral  is generally a current carrying conductor   in the case of a     volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device     since the grounded conductor  neutral  is only connected to the grounding conductor  bare or green  at the service entrance  if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current  there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load  under normal operating conditions   if you should  incorrectly  connect the grounded  neutral  conductor to the grounding conductor at the load  some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor   since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor  it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end   if the load equipment has a metal case  which is connected to the grounding conductor through the  u  ground plug  the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential   the difference  under normal  non short circuit conditions  may be only a few tenths of a volt  but it could also be a volt or two   this normally does not present a shock hazard     however  if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe  a radiator  a metal air conditioning duct or such  part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path   if the contact is not solid  you will get a significant arc  a low voltage  but possibly moderate current arc  under the wrong conditions  this arcing could start a fire   it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size  causing it to overheat   with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral  if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral  the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor  which increases the possibility for shock or fire     also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground  the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment  often causing malfunction   i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment   the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling   this is done primarily for lightning protection  so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground  and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly   the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer   some of it flows through the grounding electrode  water pipe  etc   this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks  and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the  hot  conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground   there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy    don t flame me on this  i m just telling you where the field comes from  not it s health effect  as far as i m concerned  the jury is still out on this    note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel  not at any sub distribution panels   this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel  you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral   the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor   if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel  say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw  all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground  with the possible problems listed above   the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers  as well as feeds from one building to another   in the cases of the range and dryer  the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions  instead of a seperate wire   every time the code is revised  these exceptions come up for review   these exceptions were  in fact the first required safety grounds  in the days before u ground outlets and such   the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers  and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable  with four fairly heavy  expensive wires  in place of three wire to the appliances   no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove  but the neutral current is low for most burner settings  since most current is in the     volt  hots  except at some low settings  the wires are large gauge  and there are few reported cases of injury or damage   so far  the exceptions have survived  in the case of feeds between buildings  it s primarily for lightning protection   people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor   obviously  the bare wire in  romex   with ground  is   anywhere there is a green wire installed  such as in a portable cord  that is a good grounding conductor   the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor  in the us    bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath   you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends  you don t have to bond it to anything  it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath   conduit or emt  thinwall tubing  is generally a legal grounding conductor  but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel  particularly for larger pipes      greenfield   looks like big bx  but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it  is not a legal grounding conductor  as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it  and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance   you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield    wiremold  is also not a legal grounding conductor  as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact  and the  feed  to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box   i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were  hot  with     volts  why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office   because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box   you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring  conduit  bx  etc   where you can  bond  the wire to the box with a screw  bnding clip  or whatever   on another issue  while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them  it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available   it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it   the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip   it is desirable to connect the ground if available  because if the ground is connected  the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in  whereas without the ground  it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path   for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s  read in the nec         d

this board would be most appropriate      i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that     are ever present at nuclear poer sites  they look like cylinders     that have been pinched in the middle  does anybody know what the     actual purpose of those things are   i hear that they re called      cooling towers  but what the heck do they cool   great explaination  however you left off one detail  why do you always  see them at nuclear plants  but not always at fossil fuel plants   at  nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle  whereas  fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot  water   as i recall the water isn t as hot  thermodynamically  in many  fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive  contamination          actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling water reactor nuclear plants    there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses      vintage steam technology    so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible   hence big cooling towers            oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers  but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water  not most of the way down to ambient   some plants do cool the condensers with water  rather than air  as one canadian official  asked about  thermal  pollution  de icing a river  said   up here  we view heat as a resource             everybody runs closed cycle boilers   the water used is  purified of solids  which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils   purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  cooling it  so the boiler water is recycled        john nagle  newsgroup  sci electronics document id

fast   very forgiving and easy to work with  beware static electricity   but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too    there are neat devices in this family that exist in no

it should be noted that the hourglass shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants   it should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful  the cooling towers are only used part time  when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit  it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish  fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect

fiddled    with the tuning  tracking and vertical hold but it was no good       it sounds like your tv is one of the ones that also reacts to the video  protection    poor you    the macroscrubber from radio electronics removes the protection so you  souldn t have any more problems   however  if you use the method of  copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr doesn t react to  the protection  you will end up with a duplicate tape  including the  protection   one thought comes to mind about your problem     when playing the tape  for viewing  are you feeding the signal from the source vcr through an  extra device before going to the tv   if you feed it through a second vcr  first  that is your problem   as to other devices such as converters  i  don t know if they would react or not   just to be safe  you might want  to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv   victor inqmind bison mb ca the inquiring mind bbs  winnipeg  manitoba

c l x  kj  vcd hp com   john eaton writes             during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough  to melt  when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling  tower where it is sprayed into the air  contact with the cool outside air  will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor   there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then  reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day     cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be  power companies  are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the  raw uranium emisions to be held to under     this law is now under attack  by lawyers arguing that the    should be measured at the edge of the property  rather than the edge of the cooling tower  eliminating this law will save  power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes     john eaton   hp vcd johne    i think you posted your article    days too late      april  st is over  i don t like nuclear powerplants but i think it s not fair to tell such  storys  about them  ok   let me try to explain what that tower is used to       st  even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam engine           it has an hightech  boiler  but the rest is still verry verry           conventional  and if you ve already visited any condensation           powerstation you l have seen the cooling towers too           if you look at any good book about thermophysics you ll find          a chapter about the  carnot process  which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference   and that is the reason          for cooling towers too     you only can get energy if you ve an          temperature gradient  that means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam  till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox      of the           energy you  or better the uranium  brought into the water to          let it boil  if you only have hot steam on the one and  cold           steam on the other side you ll loose much more of the energy           and so they cool down the steam to get at least the     of          energy that carnot will give them           the cooling towers are for cooling the steam            the vapor you ll see is not the steam of the main core circulation           because that steam is radioactive   the circulation is divided in          at least   circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment                  nd  ok  the main core is hot  but even in the modernst hightemperature           reactors  htr  they only run at      deg celsius  this is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around      deg  celsius   but you ll have lot s of problems with          the boiler s steel  that s because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast           this is only for bwr s  the new he cooled reactors have temperatures          up to      deg  celsius  but this is only experimental         rd  i personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years  today   mrem and next year     mrem won t be      mrem          at all  it accumulates and even in    years you ll still have              mrem  and i m not interested in glowing in the night and

john de armond  subject  re  what do nuclear site s cooling towers do   nagle netcom com  john nagle  writes     great explaination  however you left off one detail  why do you always   see them at nuclear plants  but not always at fossil fuel plants   at   nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle  whereas   fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot   water   as i recall the water isn t as hot  thermodynamically  in many   fossil fuel plants  and of course there is less danger of radioactive   contamination   actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are    fossil units  multiple units per plant  are generally smaller than nuclear plants       mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built   the average nuclear plant is      mwe      many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted   why those old dirt burners can t harm anything  let  em go          powered draft cooling towers  low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site  are quite popular with fossil plants      fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears           actually  fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual   boiling water reactor nuclear plants    there s a gripe in the industry  that nuclear power uses      vintage steam technology    so it s  more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system  as cold as possible   hence big cooling towers             oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers  but they  usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water  not most of the  way down to ambient   some plants do cool the condensers with water   rather than air  as one canadian official  asked about  thermal   pollution  de icing a river  said   up here  we view heat as a resource      actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size   the issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from   condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine   the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature   it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes   the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best     a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell  where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes    since the condenser is at a very low pressure  the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity   if the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low  the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate   this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs     the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps   how much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell   typically hotwell temperatures run between     and      degrees depending on the temperature of the river water  this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped    when the river water temperature is high in the summer  operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head   there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area   at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air      the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers   the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity   it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding    degrees   a vast difference from the typical         days     degrees      humidity  we see routinely in the east  it is not unusual  particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant  for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure           everybody runs closed cycle boilers   the water used is   purified of solids  which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when  the water boils   purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than   cooling it  so the boiler water is recycled   true   actually secondary plant  the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler  water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves  the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water   by  impure   i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen   secondary water is now typically the most

as it was   properly designed and robust  premium components are used  it   shouldn t matter where it is assembled   definately  i agree wholeheartedly   if they can build the amp where   the labour is not so expensive  they can afford to put decent   components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the   amplifier   as adcom has done      i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last   not with      those quality components inside   sure the amp runs very fairly      hot   but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good     an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound    the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day     actually  i d be wary of excessively hot amps   cauz even though   the components inside may be rated to run that way  excessive    heat will dramatically shorten the life of  any  electronic component   regardless of quality   in fact  an amp that does run hot to the touch is   because either the engineer or

those zebra connectors and fail to operate     now we buy flukes  the low end    series mostly   and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone      what the world needs is a meter that won t let you change ranges or turn it on off with a lead stuck in the amps jack   a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans  anyway     not that i ve

that the new gps boxes now have an option  known as  differential ready    apparently land based  beacons tranmit gps correction information to your gps   receiver  with differential option installed     how does this system work   what frequency is used for  the land based beacons    thanks in advance    charlie thompson     here s a rough sketch of how the system works   a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals   these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion  sa  selective availability  time dithering  etc   the reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to  back out  the errors in its position  since it knows where it is already    it then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers   if the receivers are nearby      km  and are using the same satellites as the reference unit  the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit   thus  the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit   the us coast guard is currently  as far as i know  installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps   these stations will use existing radio towers   i believe the frequency is to be approximately     khz   there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies   for example  pinpoint                  offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us   the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm     format  advertised accuracies espouse   to   meter errors

deflection coil of other monitors to be specific  have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem  this sounds like your problem since flourescent lites  motors  etc several   s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it  but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor  fusebox on other side of wall maybe  we started spec ing panasonic ct     y video monitors    switchable input lines vid   aud  s vhs on one         this stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it   now on to your problem  you need what is known as mu shielding  very common  in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type o scopes   i talked to a ee prof  he said get a coffee can  cut both ends off  mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor   be careful to avoid all high voltage circuitry  especially the thicker high voltage anode lead usually colored red  if you kill yourself  don t blame sue me    use plastic or other non conducting stand offs and such to mount can  now  i would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out  so hopefully this ll work by mounting shield on

is the particular chip dead  it is a pull  not new    moreover  the place i bought it from is sending me an xc     rc     i thought  that the      rc   were labeled mc not xc  for not finalized mask

level noise   i have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that i am using  analogic       has some relatively large common mode noise on it   i am using this synthesizer to  null  out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference      uv  several hundred  times   the      has about     mvp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat    the noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency  and on a spectrum analyzer  the main component is about   hz    how can i get rid of the noise   when i look at the spectrum using an hp     a  audio range analyzer   the noise goes away the minute i switch to   isolation  on the input   i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to dc   also  if i use a differential amplifier  ia  to solve the problem   how important is it to use one of these  shield drivers   an amp connected  to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused  by different cable capacitances    if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for  use with transient signals with content from  khz to about    khz  i would appreciate it     newsgroup  sci electronics

i m sorry if somebody already mentioned   this  but you could grab a lemon  i think potatoes work too  but i m not   sure   a strip of copper  and a strip of zinc  i think you can get the   metal in a hardware store or hobby shop  maybe      stick the strips in   the lemon  so they don t touch   and you ll get a measurable voltage  not   a lot  but  hey  it s a lemon          as i recall we had to hook   something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of   current  because of the mondo internal resistance  but if you just need a   demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or

would this be a correct presumption   what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects     the affected equipment is about     feet from the road     hams can legally run up to      watts   it is very unlikely  however  that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car   ham rigs for cars put out around     watts   it is possible that a     watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic     feet  away   most tvs  stereos  and vcrs have very poor rf shielding  if you experience the problem frequently  it may be  caused by a ham  cber  or other radio operator in a base station nearby     the interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes  such as police  fire  etc   if you heard voices over your stereo  i think you are correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter   if you have frequent trouble  you may want to try the rf ferrite chokes available at radio shack   the interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires  and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily  without cutting them   good instructions are included with the chokes  if that does not solve the problem  you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator   look for antennas on the roof or car   talk to him her about your problem   there are things a radio operator can do to reduce

automation a bit  namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up   our current automation consoles date from the early    s and don t provide this function   we already have the combo failsafe contact rollers to read the cuetapes  and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade up control circuit      vac  is momentarily closed  for at least     second   i ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a   v relay  activated when the cue tape completes the circuit   low tech and simple  but there s one problem   in order to get the     second pulse  there needs to be a sh  load of cuetape on the film      mm runs at    feet per minute  so to get a     second pulse  there needs to be at least   inches of solid cuetape    ideally  i would like to use a single cross cue to accomplish this function   a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film  this would give a pulse of approximately       of a second  what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around     second   the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice   i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort   i m sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads   any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated    thanks   mark fontana        of all the arts  the cinema is     mark a

to build a circuit that detects the presence of video  vs  a blank screen  by monitoring the r g  and b outputs of a graphics card   it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at    mhz  which would mean detecting a    ns pulse   it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen  about     mv  and a dim screen  say  around     mv    oh yes  it also needs to be cheap     my first circuit was a dismal failure   i used   compariators  each compariator had the   input going to one of the guns  the   input went to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer    the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow   i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators  so i could have a whole screen full of text  but my circuit would not detect it      the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen   in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only     mv   i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work     there are faster compariators  but they are expensive  and require  split supplies    i would need to replace my     quad compariator with three      compariators  and create a whole new power supply circuit     at this point  i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit   transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick     unfortunately  i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits  so i am appealing to the net for help   any ideas  tips  circuits  pointers  references  etc  would be greatly appreciated     oh yes  i only sample the output of this thing every second or so  so i don

is about     feet from the road     hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp   and are also unlikely to have a  dirty  amp      hams can legally run up to      watts   it is very unlikely  however     that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car   ham rigs  not possible either   you d need about a     amp alternator for just the amplifier   i can just see it   you need to slow down on

most tvs  stereos  and vcrs have very poor rf shielding     if you experience the problem frequently  it may be     caused by a ham  cber  or other radio operator in a base station    nearby     the interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes  such as police  fire     etc   if you heard voices over your stereo  i think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter      if you have frequent trouble  you may want to try the rf ferrite    chokes available at radio shack   the interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires  and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily  without cutting them      good instructions are included with the chokes     if that does not solve the problem  you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator   look for antennas on the roof    or car   talk to him her about your problem   there are things    a radio operator can do to reduce

information that you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of  human body landmarks  eg  the selspot system by selspot ab  sweden  and the watsmart system       these use lateral photoeffect detectors  lindholm and oberg        woltring and marsolais        to determine the position of a spot of light projected  using a camera lens  over its surface   in escence  the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes  one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal  and a single anode  the back of the crystal    a spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector s face   let s try some ascii graphics in   d  so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position

by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina  tion  the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power    when this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light  then the way of  tuning  to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal  light the led for an equal time and sample that signal separately   the difference between the two is the position of

design   i will  however  point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected   remember that any interference is wasted power  if i put out  w in the tv band  that s  w that i am not putting out in the band i am trying to transmit on  and  w can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall  and nothing   cbers  however  are usually not as helpful   most illegal cbers  however  will stop operation when you inform them of a problem   the rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local fcc office of the problem  in writing  and giving details and addresses     last  you can usually tell ham radio vs  cb   ham operators are  required to declare their call  sign  every so many minutes  no more  than       so if you hear  this is wa qt  or some other call starting  with a  w or k and no more than   total characters  you heard a ham   cb ers probably won t sign  i don t know that they re even required  to  and fire police have other private ids   good advice   hams will frequently give their call  and will never use a  handle    they are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well  but that s not

work        hello       let me introduce a problem      when i measure a sinusoidal wave  voltage  with a digital voltmeter  using  ac mode  my output is an rms value  a peak value over   squared     right        when i measure a square wave in the same mode  ac   my output is equal  to a peak value  actually  to the upper flat boundary of the wave     i assumed  that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the  input value  and divides it over the wave period    right      now  i used it to measure the same  square wave as above  but distorted  by high frequency harmonics  ideally  output should be the same  but    the output value was only about     of the previous one      why  what is the nature of this output value  what does the voltmeter  actually measure  and

it is  nearly uv     i m sure you can figure out now just what  far uv  is    regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum  such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source   stronger sources are going to require gas  probably mercury vapor  discharge tubes  such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor    be careful  though  strong uv sources can cause physiological damage  especially to the eyes   the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous   it wouldn t project a beam like a flashlight  but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source   it would be bright enough to be useful  but not dangerously so      ed hall

commercial ssi implementations allow you to use one as such  strictly  a   of   decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state  according to the inputs   a demux  on the other hand  uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal  so there are three inputs required   a decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input  since this can be used as the data input  e g  when high  all outputs are high  when low  only the selected  by control inputs  output will be low    an eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit  bit    to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled  thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits  note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux  since you have no data input  the enable line on a four way decoder  left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose   a sixteen way decoder obviously requires four  four way decoders  plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time  therefore  use the fifth decoder  attached to the two high order bits  to provide the four enable lines   of course  the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders   please give me the credit when you submit your homework   johnh

bc d    acd    abc    ab c    the books on logic design i have consulted all seem to imply that this  is where the analysis ends       but by factoring out the   a  term in the function  we can get fewer gates    f a b c d    bc d    a cd    bc    b c     which yields   gates     yes  but    the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations   a ttl gate has the basic structure of and or invert  and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay   the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization    a positive or gate  such as the   gate solution uses  has two gate delays  and there s another gate delay in the second term  so that the second solution  while simpler in logic symbols  can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world  ecl is similar to ttl  in that it can support an or and gate with the minimum delay  unlike ttl  you get both true and inverse outputs for  free  when using ecl     pals are basically large programmable and or invert gates  with your choice of internal connections between the various sections  and perhaps some latches   so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few pals   it s not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates  but some software packages claim to allow you to do so  and will take just about any mess of gates  as a nodelist with   xxx series logic ics  and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job   xilinx s xact software does this by treating

experience with it the       unfortunately i want to switch an  ac signal which goes from about   v to  v  and the      is only  for positive signals           i have a carrier signal which varies

 hmmm   how are those orange  isolated ground  outlets  often used in  computer rooms  wired     they require two separate grounds   one ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet  and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet s mounting tabs  and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate  if any    the box faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground  the outlet ground pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is  in turn  connected to the building entrance main ground by its own wire   so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building s service entrance   but one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building  while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated ground outlets of that panel   if someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a    v feeder to ground  the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows  while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise free   newsgroup  sci electronics document id

better fidelity  wouldn t i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process   furthermore  am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate  from the player s point of view  as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium   does this mean that the data rate  related to the rotational speed of the disk  has  changed since        i m

neutral return wires when things in the house are operating   there should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition   notice also that in the breaker box there is a wire

from  kolstad cae wisc edu  joel kolstad  subject  re   x oversampling cd player  in article  hcbc un l dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes     hello      i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that  it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think  i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples   exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor    i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when  i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs  said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting  senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take  samples at a higher rate   if i really wanted better fidelity  wouldn t  i have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording  process   furthermore  am i wrong in interpreting the sampling rate   from the player s point of view  as being the same thing as the data  rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium   does this mean  that the data rate  related to the rotational speed of the disk  has   changed since         note  i just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself  from various people on the net  so i could be wrong    the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course   and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data  oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more complicated   anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective  sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias filtering           joel kolstad  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  galen picea cfnr colostate edu  galen watts  subject  re  suggestions  on audio relays

there are bubblejets  and then there are bubblejets   there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output   such as hp s dinky little bubblejet   whereas most produce really good  looking output  such as hp s deskjets    ibm and canon both produce some of  the really good style bubblejets    p s     if you re in the market for a portable bubblejet printer  i can  highly recommend the hp portable deskjet  although i ve heard the portable  canons are good too  i needed pcl support  myself    with the deskjet  portable  you even get an undocumented pcmcia card slot   i second that suggestion   although i don t own the hp portable deskjet  i  do  own the hp deskjet       it gives the nicest outputs  with only a minor loss of quality    for all intensive purposes  papers  letters  resumes   i treat my deskjet like a laser printer  you  do  have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters    only one grudge  the ink that hp gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture  even though the ink is waterproof    however  you would have to spend about      more for laser quality   the cannon bubblejets are nice  however they don t seem to have as much support  eg  drivers for popular programs  as the hp ink jets  also hp deskjet  regular plus        c  accepts xerox paper  i believe that the cut sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet    if you don t mind refilling your printer with cheap ink  say fountain pen ink   then the hp deskjets are  very  cheap to maintain  i paid       for my last bottle of ink and i

setting    put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven   set oven to     degrees  the lowest setting on my oven   if yours goes down to     that s probably even better    stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch   this allows for airflow   leave the stuff in the oven for   to   hours

piped into a command center they re building somewhere in the east bay   i m not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data  but large multi colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway   an announcer will sit in front of the status  wall   and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it   they re apparently also looking into licensing a low am frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system   in the mean time  they ll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead   my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program  and information from it will be available free of charge   perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate  read  cheap     we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels   and      these are verbal reports  qualified with a identification tone to tell in vehicle receivers like the  auto talk  that the information coming next is applicable to a given area   in la  they re probably using some other tv channels  but the concept is the same   try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel  and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information  i believe this program is also subsidized  making the in vehicle receivers cheap to purchase  and without having to incur monthly fees to use it    since the makers of these in vehicle receivers don t have to pay for the broadcast  this may not be completely true   they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves   you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car  nothing more  when this happens   perhaps a word to the

adjustable from     v current     limited  at  a  voltage must stay within    of designated value for i from    a ac ripple less than   mv  rms   of course  we can t just use an adjustable voltage  current limiting regulator chip      our problem is with the current limiting  i e  we ve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit    what the supply must do  if presented with a load which would draw more than  a  given the supply voltage  is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp   thus  if we were to short the thing with the ammeter  we should read one amp   if we measure the current through a   ohm  resistor at   v  we should read one amp  and the output voltage  by necessity  must be  v   the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor  and therefore reduce the output   so  does anybody have any ideas we could work from   thanks in advance   andy

guts on straight dc instead of an inverter    why not do it all the time   then there d be no switchover to screw   things up  and no having to sense the failure fast   just keep the dc   on charge when the power is on  and it ll be there in zero time when   you  need  it       actually  it s a bit more complicated than that   i sounds to me   your ups takes in ac  rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries  and  then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again  feeding your  equipment   this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to  switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since   as you mentioned  nothing will know about what happened down the line    another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you  lose power  and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to  replace the lost power   the problem here is the switchover time and  you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat  that s a standby unit not a ups  otherwise there would be no interuption  many standby units are labled as ups s though        morgan bullard mb     coewl cen uiuc edu        or  mjbb uxa cso uiuc edu    unfortunately  most everything is built around the

article  kolstad cae wisc edu  joel kolstad  writes   in article  hcbc un l dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes       i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that   it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think   i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples    exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor     i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when   i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs   said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting   senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take   samples at a higher rate      the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course    and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data   oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points  between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the  interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more  complicated   you are quite correct in your understanding   the filtering is not interpolation  as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to   generally  these players run the samples thru an all pass filter network   i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s heart  and the effect is rather spooky   it actually reconstructs peaks that weren t there  correctly  too   and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values  just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point   i use a cpu to do all the math   it takes a decent  but not unreasonable  amount of cpu time to do this   you can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code   in case you care  the filtering method uses an fir  finite impulse response  filter   i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method   anybody out there know the real answer   i d say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering   this strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs     anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective   sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency  antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling  lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher  oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of  all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should  allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias  filtering   actually  i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic   i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not   you can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp    it s too bad that they charge more for something that  i think  is actually less costly to build   i seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better   they are built to a price spec  and that spec says  cheap as possible                joel kolstad     dave     dave mcmahan                            mcmahan netcom com

pink noise  tony wayne writes    what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments    tony  pink noise is a random signal with more low frequency components than white noise   if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer  you will find that the spectrum power density is flat  which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal   often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low pass filtering a white noise signal  therefore pink noise contains much more low frequency components   the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals  an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why   enjoy it   wouter   newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  cmh eng

dd  netcom com  hcb netcom com  h  c  bowman  writes         i just bought a new portable cd player for the office  and i notice that    it proudly proclaims    times oversampling  on the box   now while i think    i understand what oversampling is  the rate of discrete  samples     exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor      i don t understand this    times  business     it seems to me that when    i bought my first cd player  was it really    years ago     the specs    said    times       could someone please tell me whether i m getting    senile   if i m not  then what good does it do for the player to take    samples at a higher rate       the data is only ever read once  barring mistracks and such  of course     and eventually gets turned into      khz     bit  two channel data    oversampling takes two discrete data points  and interpolates n   points   between them for n times oversampling   when i asked  people said that the   interpolation was not simply linear interpolation  but significantly more   complicated    you are quite correct in your understanding   the filtering is not  interpolation  as that would distort the frequency content of the signal  they do interpolate   it s not linear interpolation though  you are correct that the frequency content is not altered  more specifically  the baseband spectrum is preserved  and so is every nth image spectrum  the other  n    in n image spectra are removed  where n is the oversampling rate    you are listening to   generally  these players run the samples thru an  all pass filter network   i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s  ideally the filter has a gain of   from  hz to      hz  and a gain of   from       to the new nyquist frequency  in practice a finite transition band is required  and there is also a certain amount of pass band ripple and stop band leakage  with a high order  eg     taps  digital filter  a very good approximation can be easily achieved        bit deleted about observations of interpolation filter at work       in case you care  the filtering method uses an fir  finite impulse response   filter   i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method   anybody out  there know the real answer   i d say that they use a tapped delay line with  resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering   this strikes me as  the most cost effective method for volume production runs   no  they actually use a digital fir just like yours  but built in hardware  on custom vlsi chips for  mainly  economic reasons     anyway  then  the purpose of oversampling is to move the  effective    sampling rate up to n times      khz  in order to use higher frequency   antialiasing filters   for the same quality filter  higher oversampling   lets you build cheaper filters  whereas for the same price filter  higher   oversamplings lets you build better filters   so  assuming the quality of   all other components in a cd player remained the same  oversampling should   allow a manufacturer to produce  slightly  better sound due to anti alias   filtering    actually  i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that  they have a marketting gimic   i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to  filter an oversampled signal than not   you can use sloppier components and  give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp    it s too bad that they  charge more for something that  i think  is actually less costly to build   i guess that the answer is somewhere between the two   as an interesting     aside  some of you out there may be aware of a scheme used by pioneer and wadia  which is called  by pioneer  at least  legato link  i haven t heard one of these players  but by reading advertising blurb  and a couple of pseudo technical articles i deduced that all they do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter  and let a load of the first image  ie aliassed  spectrum through  talking to bob stuart  of boothroyd

  do they just send you some general information about the companies that  advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a  catalog    that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled  radio electronics compiles all of the cards  then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number  some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels  and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk   the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get  you will notice that the radio electronics information card  commonly called a  bingo card  in the industry  includes lines for a company name and a business phone number  my guess would be that the big  national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can  for example  if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone  and a mail stop   tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later  if you leave it blank  odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet  medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog  and then some companies  like digikey or jameco  have nothing to mail out accept the catalog   a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards  free  industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer  they use the information at least three ways  they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you  through repeated mailings  to re subscribe  they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics  this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that      of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors   and finally  some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information  for example  tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic s  in the past   months   the other point  in the data the advertiser receives  many magazines include how many items you circled on the card  if they want  the advertiser can attempt to cull out the  literature collectors  from the serious potential customers    can you say qualified sales leads  i thought you could    what s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards     never circle more than   number on the card  if you want more   than   items  use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later     if you are really  really serious and you really  really want   the information  call the advertiser and ask  this will also   cut about    days off the the response time  virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout     to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you re   not really  qualified  for  send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers     include a business name and phone number  even if it s your house

way  no document look up  no disk wear and tear   i did not say that the originals would allow only one install   the user s  conscience should do that   i know  i ll get flamed for this     but with the increasing number of  casual  users who either unknowingly or don t care about the software copyrights  it s the truth   i have  friends  who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time  and when i refused  they went after somebody else    casual pirating is becoming more of a problem   some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying   i ve seen what some of my  friends  dug up somewhere     latest and the greatest games  all cracked  within days of actual release   you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz   two   yes  two    and don t ask me which ones they are    determined pirates are unstoppable  given enough time  but their results do not spread  that far  since pirate boards are not that well known  and easily tracked once found by authorities   it is the  casual  pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage   what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup  registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the above  two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus violated their license agreement   this way  the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal  discomfort  who does major upgrades to their computer frequently   as only problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer   the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights  and can restore to different machines   on the other hand  the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is  supposed to be   if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was not  supposed to be  we know who has broken their license agreement   of course  a hacker can break that eventually  but that s not the point  is it     kasey chang  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  mchen terra cs psu

unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program  and some self rewriting code to confuse some people   also  make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger   another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk  just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector    to help you here  you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph  make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well  or they  wanna be crackers  can just look for the junk in some random sector   like you mentioned  there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys  but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user  which you is the opposite of what you want   another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of   if the program does not find that this is the same system  it requests being installed by the original disk again   the original disk should be encrypted  compacted  have many sectors that should be checked  and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied   once again  you must put code encryption  self rewriting code  and multiple crc checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed   among other things  this also protects your program from virii   if the program detects a change in its code  tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program   tell them the program is  virus secure   and remember  you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses   feel good   i hope that i have helped   have fun   knock some cracking out  well  you can

com  robert g  carpenter  writes       i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the    distance between a transmitter s  and receiver     yes  it s called radar  well  actually not quite  both radar and radio altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal  then receive its reflection from a target  radar generally uses pulses  while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave transmission  in the case of the latter  highly accurate distance measurement can be made  as an example  the original bendix ala    radio altimeter was accurate to     foot at      feet altitude   note  however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about  the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers  this cannot be wire connected  since radio waves will actually travel faster in free space  air  in this case  than wire  the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable   so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance  etc  something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick  triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously  sound expensive  not too bad  but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort   why not go to a different method  surveyors use a laser light system where again the reflection time is measured  why not try this   sounds like something a p e  should know about anyway          seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength    and determine distance  this would be for short distances       ft      and i would need to have accuracy of   inches  or so   this is actually highly inaccurate  since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit  there are variances in the antenna and transmission line  and the receiver may also vary  both from unit to unit  and the same unit over time  you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system  with the radio altimeter this is also done  but since everything is located at one place  it is much easier to do  note especially that the time base for the r a  receiver and transmitter is one unit also      depends on the environment  in a static environent such as a waveguide yes  in  a dynamic environment  with objects moving about  the multipath kills this  concept   nope  fm capture effect says that

point is to make   sure the   user is using a legitimate copy   the simplest and virtually fool proof   way is   for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed   on    some sort of checksum  serial number  whatever  so a copy put on a   different   machine  not installed from original disks  will not work        okay  so what do you do if some part of the machine  presumably the part   on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself   upon goes bad  you replace that part  and now your program won t run   because it s on a  different  computer     this is  of course  assuming that the program uses something in rom  like   the bios serial number  maybe   and not a disk based code number     obviously if the drive goes bad you ll be reinstalling the stuff anyway   i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system     we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred   machines  both pc and macintosh  as well as administering a network of   over    next machines   i personally am concerned only with a small lab   with ten pc s and ten mac s    i m not the manager  but help him with   admin often    imho  copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more   than a major headache for the legitimate user   anyone who wants a copy of   your program and doesn t care about legality will get a copy   period      pirate board  or no pirate board   i too have  friends  who blatantly and   quite successfuly  hack  copy protection schemes practically in their   sleep   let s consider what goes on in our lab   almost daily we have at least one   machine down  sometimes several  due to some goofball screwing up some   setting or other on a piece of software   admittedly  we  being students    mostly  are not the world s most efficient and effective network   administrators  but we try   keeping even the twenty machines that are    partly  my responsibility even vaguely looking and  acting  similar to   the average user  and maintaining  behind the scenes  consistency is a   real headache  but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his   disk   often we have hardware problems at peak  business  times and have to do   some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily         well  i ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all         the point is  often we have to re install software and copy configuration   files etc  from machine to machine   by far the easiest way we have found   to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to  then   copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine  of that   machine s type    this ensures us that  for at least ten minutes  we have   ten identical machines to work with   having them networked simplifies   this considerably  as our major packages  wordperfect  windows  etc   are   all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with   often  however  we need to install a package requested by some instructor   to one  some  or all of the machines for a special project   this is   usually a hand written or shareware etc  program similar to what i believe   the original poster was asking about   the few we have had with  copy   protection  schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain         in short  don t waste your time with a copy protection scheme   it s sort   of like outlawing guns   the criminals will get your program anyway  and   you will only be hurting the legitimate  honest user   write a good user s   guide and tech manual  whatever else for your program  please do this   regardless of whether you copy protect the thing      and only distribute   the manual to licensed users   jack the price to cut your losses  but   please take a cue from the major companies  who can admittedly afford the   costs of illegal copies far better than you  and don t burden the   legitimate user with a  copy protection  scheme    sorry for the tirade  but it s been a long day here              mark s  underwood ee student  university of kentucky lab assistant

after somebody else      casual   pirating is becoming more of a problem   some sort of copy protection   will   discourage the casual copying   i ve seen what some of my  friends  dug   up

ask me which ones they are      determined   pirates are unstoppable  given enough time  but their results do not   spread    that far  since pirate boards are not that well known  and easily   tracked once   found by authorities   it is the  casual  pirates that the copy   protection is   determined to discourage       what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus   a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup    registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the   above    two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and   makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is   encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a   stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus   violated their license agreement       this way  the legitimate users who does not register will experience   minimal    discomfort  who does major upgrades to their computer frequently   as   only   problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer       the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and   therefore   gains full rights  and can restore to different machines   on the other   hand    the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is    supposed to be   if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was   not    supposed to be  we know who has broken their license agreement   of   course    a hacker can break that eventually  but that s not the point  is it         kasey

a discharged state  will develop a condition i think is called sulfation   in storage  either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use  fat chance i d ever do that at home   or the battery should be stored on a trickle charge   i have also  i think  read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a long period of time  the refernce i remember is to use c     where c is the amp hours  as the charging circuit  and leave it hooked up for weeks   some of this may only apply to gel type cells  but i suspect the same applies

we d had them  sometimes    i think murphy s law holds true more often than newton s    when we needed    them   i think it s sortof like snake antivenin           of the time you    have absolutely no use for it  but when you need it  boy do you ever need    it     ditto s     in fact    at work  where things are dead if the backup is no good  i insist on having at least a   level backup system    it seems that whenever you have   good backups  you never need them   but if you don t have them  murphy guarantees that you ll suffer for it    i don t have backups of my originals at  home  but then my machine doesn t    see anywhere near the use abuse of these here at the lab  and so i    consider it less of a risk   still  i usually make  working copies  of    them when i install them and

suggestions  on audio relays      in article  c qsbf iek ms uky edu   billq ms uky edu  billy quinn  writes     i built a little project using the radio shack  vdc relays to switch    audio   i got pretty bad  clicks  when the thing switched   i was doing    most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and    nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks         my question is          is there a good relay relay circuit that i can use for switching    audio  so that there will be  no  noise of any kind on the audio lines         i will appreciate any advice or references to advice   also  exact part    numbers company names etc  for the relays will help   the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component  intentional or not  on the audio lines to be switched  if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level  let s say they re capacitively coupled   then putting a    k resistor from each input to ground  and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click   if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage  then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own   if you have more than one relay  each relay switching one input through to a common output   you can use make before break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change  this may mask the switch click   an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor  ldr  sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink  many broadcast consoles use this older  but time honored technique  claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this  but i don t have a part number handy  radio shack has a ldr grab bag            you might want to try   for a simple  solid state clickless switch that is cheap  you might try  looking at the cd     analog switch that is commonly available  or its older predecessor  the        again  the dc component must be removed prior to switching  other alternatives include jfet switches  both discrete and ic  and diode switching  which works relatively well  surprisingly   all the above  with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi page article   solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state  techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch  differential switching  and slowing the risetime of the control pulse  with the       cutting the click can be as simple as putting   k     k resistors in series with the control pins   hope this helps at least get you started

current limiting  acollins uclink berkeley edu  andy collins  writes     one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys         for our class project  we need to design and build a power supply   to the following specs       voltatge   adjustable from     v   current     limited  at  a      voltage must stay within    of designated value for i from    a   ac ripple less than   mv  rms       of course  we can t just use an adjustable voltage  current limiting   regulator chip          our problem is with the current limiting  i e  we ve found stuff to   do the rest of the parts of the circuit    what the supply must do    if presented with a load which would draw more than  a  given the   supply voltage  is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal   one amp   thus  if we were to short the thing with the ammeter  we   should read one amp   if we measure the current through a   ohm    resistor at   v  we should read one amp  and the output voltage  by   necessity  must be  v       the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves   a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output    power transistor  and therefore reduce the output       so  does anybody have any ideas we could work from       thanks in advance       andy collins  kc yey   acollins uclink berkeley edu      ps  if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project  i agree fully        but i still have to do it  its graded         you can design for ramp shutoff  brick wall current limit or even  fold back cutoff    sounds like you want  brick wall  current limit   your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base  drive  in order to get the brick  wall  you need enough voltage gain on  the current sensor   normally a darlington on the current sensing  resistor will be adequate  but for infinite gain   use an op amp to sense  the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to  turn off the base bias on the series pass transistor   phase compensation  may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more  than     degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok

implement the above plus    a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup     registered to xxxxx    address  city  state zip  and disables the above     two benefits     encourages registration     cuts down on pirating and    makes it more traceable  because if the patch s registration message is    encrypted  it will be quite hard to change  and therefore provides a    stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands  and thus    violated their license agreement        you take two copies with a different registration id  compare them byte for    byte and you know where they are located  usually you will be able to    find out what is what after that     probably  but the point is the company make the registration patch  not  you   sure  you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes   but why   it s not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking    problem about people who cut too much from quoting        and what

i ve had something similar in mind  what if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address  data   when the user registers  you don t even need to send executable code   just compute his her key and send him her instructions to enter in the  appropriate place the following   name joe doe address     main street city anytown  ca key ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd  every user needs a unique key   the executable can propagate as much as you  like  the author can respond to the registration by e mail  post card   whatever   unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else s name  showing up  maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message     authorized users can make as many copies as they like  upgrade their  machines  whatever   the main

characteristic   if the user    did an upgrade to the machine  he she should reinstall all programs any way     no document look up  no disk wear and tear        this is not a good idea   i upgraded my motherboard last fall   i  would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to  reinstall simply because i changed motherboards     opinion is understandable        i assume you have a tape drive   not all of us have about     floppies around for backup  you know       any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum   are you  going to require that a user re install all their software if they add  mb  of ram to their computer   i did that a couple of weeks ago   it s in the  bios  and if software had told me  this isn t the machine you installed me  on  i would never have used that software again   really bad idea    ram is something you add all the time  so no   it s more like bios manufacturer and or processor type          etc    data cannot be used

for update         it would be perfectly reasonable     sort of        i did not say that the originals would allow only one install   the user s    conscience should do that        this is silly   it s much easier to loan disks to a friend and let  them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk  and then give  them that   your scheme isn t going to stop anyone    of course it is easier   are you saying then the originals should allow only one install   what is your point        you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable    the quiz   two   yes  two    and don t ask me which ones they are        do you know any assembly language at all   all anyone needs to do if  find the part of the code that does the quiz  and insert a jmp instruction  to just completely skip it   not that difficult  really   and there is very  little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing   using pklite or  some similar utility would help  but only if the resulting compressed  exe  were tagged as uncompressable    i know x   and    x  assembly quite well  thank you   i know exactly which two bytes need to be changed  i have the code to do them too   i just said  don t ask me which ones    i didn t say i don t know what that means   such hacking can be easily discouraged by adding anti patching code which does a self check upon execution and refuse to load if crc does not match value stored  encrypted  of course  in the program   it could be claimed as a part of anti virus code  and it would not be far from the truth         what i believe the

to the question of   what s your name  so this won t stop them in the long run    did anyone read what i wrote   that is not what i wrote   or meant      what i said was the program should have certain restriction  such as the restrict to one machine  until the program is registered with the manufacturer   the manufacturer will then supply the then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the  registered to xxx  screen       pirates are always going to win this fight   they simply have more  time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme    of course they will  but that was not my point   the purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates   oh  can i have a copy of that    sure  here    and the less sophisticated pirates   let s look for all those calls to int  h         any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed   they can always backtrace the entire load sequence of the program   the point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses  or to minimize such intrusion  of legitimate use   pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them  and no amount of copy protection will stop them  but the rest of us will be stopped   how many of these hardcore pirates are there

 carter ames  writes         why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead  totally unuseable    when stored on a concrete floor        i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle   from the unheated garage this year   to preserve them  and i just   went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work  but    they act like the two terminals are shorted   i asked a friend   and he said that you should never do that   cause it ruins them    but he couldn t tell me why     this topic was beaten to death a year or so ago     the concrete is not the problem      lead acid batteries often fail from disuse  not being charged for a long  time   but there s no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the  problem   the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate  that s why the old wives  tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast      it insulates the battery thermally  it you ll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam  it will self discharge even slower  the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly  but also trickle charge it every couple days too to  shallow  cycle  the charge in the battery  such mild  exercising  of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage  if you do remove the electrolyte  may sure you keep separate

 when stored on a concrete floor       i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle  from the unheated garage this year   to preserve them  and i just  went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work  but   they act like the two terminals are shorted   i asked a friend  and he said that you should never do that   cause it ruins them   but he couldn t tell me why   i don t see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the battery   however  you would have been better off leaving them outside  keeping them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside  a warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold one   when you are storing a battery it s a good idea to charge it once a month  letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it  i suspect this is what caused your problems                                                                                       robert wiegand   motorola inc  wiegand rtsg mot com

batteries   concrete   neal cmptrc lonestar org  neal howard  writes    the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a  colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate  that s  why the old wives  tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works  to help keep from killing the battery as fast      it insulates the battery  thermally  it you ll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam  it will  self discharge even slower   there are a number of inaccuracies here     in fact  a colder battery will self discharge more slowly   this is why    batteries should be stored in a cool  dry place     an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed    on wood   the battery  the wood  and the concrete will all be at the    same general temperature  ignoring temperature fluctuations  and thus    none will effect the other    the best thing would be to attach a small load  such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it  on constantly  but also trickle charge it every couple days too to  shallow   cycle  the charge in the battery  such mild  exercising  of a lead acid  battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for  storage   there is no need to  exercise  the battery   just keep it charged    a trickle charger will do the job     stuff deleted

 neat      you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage      can you tell us more about what you re doing  sounds like a very cool program   tis  only a gleam in my eye at this point   i have yet to chose a tracking  method   the initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage   i did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition   and dancers stand still alot  so their ir signature goes away   the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body  or body part   and the velocity of said body  this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture   dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies  but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked   the current toy i have been working with is a program called mandala for the amiga  used with a live  video digitizer   this works with a video camera  trained on the stage   you can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view  and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event  events can be midi objects or sequences  amiga sounds or graphic objects   it s been fun to play with  but the documentaion is arcane  and the digitizer is noisy  still  it s very appealing  the dancers don t have to wear any appliances  you can have ots of zone s  it speaks midi  which can be used to control lights  and i don t have to build any electronics   it s all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments   i have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic  but i have hopes      newsgroup  sci electronics

anything that puts out serious    amps    i know it can be done  i have some  v    a guts on my    bench  but something puzzles me  i m using a simple choke as     the storage element  basicly a toroid with a single winding     but all commercial models use transformers with many windings     i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for    the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose    me    what are they for  better than that  anyone have a full    schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of  i d    love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such    low volume      most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage  that s handled by the big caps on the primary side  those which in a  linearly regulated power supply would be considered the  filter  caps  coming right after the bridge   the transformer is just that   a  transformer   it s there primarily to step the voltage up or down    although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible  as anyone who s zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a  snubber  diode across it would tell you   actually  many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in    the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this  in a somewhat simplified manner    the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage  more or less unregulated dc rail   the energy storage  or  filter   caps appear across this rail  as does the switching transistor  the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer  resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary  which  are then rectified and filtered   at least one of the transformer s outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor  which acts in a  pulse width modulation   pwm  fashion to control  by varying the pulse width  the amount of energy being dumped into the primary  and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary   the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will  more or less tracking the regulated output  or they may have some additional linear regulation added   you may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the pwm control  which is most typically an ic  is not done via a direct electrical connection  this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated   often  the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement   while the transformer isn t the primary energy storage device in these designs  this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored  besides the inductive  kick  giving the switch transistor a bad time  as noted above   you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went  in  to the transformer back  out  again  one way or another  in some designs  this happens more or less automatically   but in others  you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn t saturate  which again would have disastrous results  best left to the  imagination         i m not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer   hopefully  a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above    bob myers  kc ew   hewlett packard co        opinions expressed here are not                    systems technology div    those of my employer or any

couldn t tell me why     it s not the concrete floor that does it  the problem is that lead acid cells self discharge over time  even high quality cells  gates for instance  will discharge        over

      the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer   results in much less spread than ink drop technology   in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed  with inkjet because smudges etc  can happen     it doesn t take much investigation to see that the mechanical and   electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than   inexpensive ink jet printers   recall also that laser printers   offer a much higher throughput      ppm for a laser versus about     ppm for an ink jet printer   a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the  first  sheet take to print  inkjets are faster than  you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the  printer   i have a        and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the  printer   a sage said to me   do you want one copy or lots of copies     one     inkjet       something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the   life of the printer   a      page yield toner cartridge is about    us       at discount while hp high capacity            page yield    cartridges are about  us    at discount   it could be that over the   life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are   less than ink jet printers   it is getting progressively closer   between the two technologies   laser printers are usually desinged   for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product   replacement cycles   paper cost is the same and both can use refills  long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts  consumables  and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer   hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver    there is one wild difference between the two printers  a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer  this

of people and software  it seems that a good majority of people  say      will at some point copy a friend s program   gee  you really oughta try this   or accept a copy  these are people who normally would buy a software package or do without  but decided that just once it wouldn t matter   the last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one  computer  most people aren t going to

processing   all the camera store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart  toss the film cassette into the to be processed bin  and throw the battery in one trashcan and the

 they were left in their places that they needed to be   one in the riding lawnmower  what a lux  and one in each motorcycle   the battery in the  riding lawnmower was about     years old  and one of the cycle batteries  was new  and one was around   years old   upon spring time  i discovered that all of the batteries were dead  and needed to be recharged   they all worked properly  except for the older ones  and they had to be replaced  about halfway through the summer    they had originally been stored in the garage  and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring    last year  i decided to bring them in to the basement  which has two parts  one is dirt and brick  and the other is concrete   i brought in all three  and discovered in the spring   about    days ago  that not only were the batteries dead  but when i put the charger on them  the charger said  hmmmmmmmm  and  the amp meter read around                 in other words  it was pinned  the internal circut tripped  and i went on to the other batteries   they were the same       realizing that we still had   gigantic sailboat batteries  also lead acid  i decided to put the charger on them    these had been sitting for around   and a half years  on the brick and dirt part  and noticed that they only needed a small charge  around   hours or so on trickle   i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts  and they worked fine for around    of  em     this leads me to believe one of several things          i bought really    tty batteries last year   sorta true          the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the         batteries          there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the            room where the concrete is           the

feet underground  there isn t going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it s sitting on        question   why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the   surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it   because the temperature of your hand   unlike that of the battery   is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss   you re feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object  your hand  which is kept much warmer than its surroundings   in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production  this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings  if it started out not in equilibrium with them  but won t affect the final temperature   for the same reason  windchill affects

noise built in   most all from audio  control have them i know the c     does       with regards to what you wrote  how does one  adjust for room dynamics  and stuff like that    i asked a professor that question just last week and he didn t really know himself   since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states  say  the surface of the silicon where there s a lack of a covalent bond  that act as  traps  to nearby elecrons  and since this happens at low frequencies  because at high frequencies they aren t able to  trap  electrons   how do you compensate for that   it seems to me that you wouldn t be able to compensate for pink noise   i have seen the  pink noise  feature  however  on many eqs  and i was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to  man made noise  like power lines  crosstalks  coupling  etc   if you have any information about this  it would be appreciated   hope this didn t sound too drawn out   thanx

 wrong  it had     bytes of ram from the riot   this was multiply mapped into  both page    pseudo registers  and page    stack   and also throughout the  bottom  k of memory   tia registers also sat in this address space     as     bytes of ram was somewhat limiting  some later cartridges also carried  ram themselves  which was interesting as atari had provided no write line  to the cart   this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address  range  and the writes into another  but all the time this scheme ate into  the  very  scarce rom address space            ian     newsgroup

is about     feet from the road         might be a couple of hundred watts  from the sound of it   kicking sound   out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a   mighty strong carrier    i ve heard of linears so powerful that   triggering them while the car was idling  would stall the engine by   pulling down the battery voltage    it would take a lot more than that  it sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off   but just goes to a standby situation   i suspect that the stories are just that  stories   the voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously  when you try to jumpstart someones  car  when your vehicle is at idle  does your car stall  no  the other car just does not crank well   now  the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with  when the extra current is drawn  the idle speed will drop   as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement      is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company  the fcc  or both       ultimately it s likely to be your problem to resolve  i m afraid   the   fcc is so understaffed that they don t pay much attention to citizen   complains about rfi  or so i ve heard     they ll just send you a   pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures       talking to the power company might help   they might be able to install   filtering devices at your service panel  or recommend a type which you   could have installed by a licensed electrician    a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power  if surges are occurring there  it is due to another cause   not a transmitter     unfortunately  there s a fair chance that enough signal is being picked   up by your house wiring that a simple service panel filter won t   suffice   you may need to install heavy duty rfi filters at the power   connections of your affected equipment   it is probably not that much of a problem  often   toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem  it will not solve internal equipment deficiencies     if the problem occurs regularly  you may need to  stake out  the street   in question  and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by   at the time interference occurs   if you can identify the vehicle which   is transmitting  you may be able to contact its owner and complain   it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault  if the person is an amateur  then he she will probably be willing to help   if you explain that the person is causing

isn t likely   every bit of signal that doesn t go out the   antenna is wasted  as far as a ham is concerned  and most hams are  it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem     technically competent to ensure that they don t waste any signal if they   can possibly avoid it   to get their ham license  they had to pass a   government exam that tests them on that point  among others       however  you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure   there are   lots of other services where the operators aren t required to be   technically competent   citizens band   cb    for example   there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all  it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers   however  that said  most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill     listen to the interference   if you hear voices clearly  it almost   certainly isn t ham radio  and might well be cb   if you can record a  don t count on that     bit of it  you could take the tape over to a local ham operator s house   and ask him for his opinion of what you re hearing   most communities  you cannot do that legally  however  you can ask a ham over to listen  if the interference occurs at a specific time each day  then it would be possible to do such scheduling   if nothing else  you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway  to see if he interferes  if he does  then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference     have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing   to help you resolve interference complaints   look in the phone book  or   ask at the local ham radio store  or call the fcc for contact info   the fcc may  or may not  have such information  they have enough to do without getting calls for such information  if nothing else  call your city offices or police department  general business number   they should have the name of a local ham contact     if it s a ham  he s more than likely willing to help get rid of the   problem   after all  it would be his signal he s wasting   if it isn t    the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions   see above   your concept of wasted signal is erroneous  if his rig is transmitting properly  then the chance of interference  with the exception of harmonic television interference  is the greatest   since he is putting out the strongest signal     it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is   operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a   piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of   the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device   that wouldn t affect one person in a thousand  but which bites you    often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable   person  perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you re   hearing   unfortunately  most consumer equipment is succeptable   it is all poorly designed      btw  hams are allowed amplifiers  cb isn t    illegal ham amplifier    doesn t

carts used to say they re dated for only   months  but i don t think they say so anymore  we stick to a   month supply  of about   carts   we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper  after fooling for a long time  laser xerox paper is also good   smearing doesn t happen  unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine  other disadvantages are   no postscript  this can be an advantage in speed  usually   ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press software solutions  i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet  but they won t release it for fear of hurting lj sales   in the end  the primary advantages of laser are true postscript  unless you go for cheap lasers   and fused toner  no smearing  even when soaking in water   lasers are slightly sharper  but the only instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board transparencies for photoetching  i found a textronix color phaser

stuff about hardware keys    if you put another computer on the port instead of the key  you can hack   them by reading what happens  so i ve been told  i ve never seen this done   but i think it s possible  you d need some hardware knowledge and some   software to read the port   true  which is why many of the newer keys ship out  oh  maybe    bits or so  have the key encrypt them  and return them to the pc   making a bunch of these    bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things won t run without the key       anyway  then  this scheme at least defeats your approach   it s a little costly  though   personally  i don t believe in copy protection  and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what

series with the tip or ring lines  of the phone wire  which ones are  those  suppose i am holding a regular phone wire  such that the little  plastic tooth  on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead  ends that you plug into the phone  is facing down  and away from me   which of the   wires that i see is the  tip  and which is the  ring    please reply to mlevin husc  harvard edu     mike levin   mike  ring is the red wire  tip is the green wire of most standard phone lines  they two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone  the two live lines   they are the two innermost connectors of an rj    phone jack   another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to green  ring to tip  tip green being at ground potential of the voltmeter   it should read     volts in the on hook no ring position   i am     sure it s     v and not     volts  doesn t hurt a phone too much if they re reversed  it s just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere    additionally  when off hook  the voltage drops to about    to    volts dc  i think it is supposed to correspond to a    to    ma current loop  and lastly  when ringing  the two wires develop an ac potential of about    v p p at    to    hz across them  where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from    hope that clears things     squish endor harvard

a seeker born every minute   writes          where can i buy blinking leds besides radio shack            does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate   by voltage      i guess  if so  what hertz  pulse  rate are they adjustable or set to          i d like blinking leds that can be set for approx   hz     hz            hz  or    hz  something like that    i m interested in what s       out there for flash rates  i like the idea of leds with flasher        circuits already in them  i hate soldering ics in general  guess i       don t have a hell of a lot of patience              thanks              dana   if you want slow led flash rates  adjustable by switches  or by a           digitally controlled switch   i suggest looking at a     oscillator chip  they cost     at radio shack  much cheaper in quantity at quality places   and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a     oscialltor notebook  i think forest mims has one at radio shack   you ll have to toy with resistor capacitor values or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies  any engineer worth his salt  can make a     osciallator    it s in the book  and left up to you to see  i hate doing ascii circuit graphics   the     can accurately go from a few hz to about     khz  i think    about the tape recorder gizmo  you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a data line  for flashing led   and one as audio line  for voice or music   this would eliminate a lot of noise   the data line is probably most easily done by some kind of pll or bandpass filter  using just an op amp   the     chip is a good pll  and not hard to work with  however if you nothing about how a pll works  i suggest you don t try this  op amp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack info booklets  and the popular     op amp is a snap to work with  setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy  so i would suggest the     method firstmost    i have no idea what this is going into  so i am really generalizing     as for manufacturing techniques  if you re only goofing with it  i suggest you breadboard the thing    no need to solder  wire wrap would be the next  more permanent step  and lastly  soldering pcb making  hope that clears things         squish endor harvard edu   newsgroup  sci electronics document id

camter   astro ocis temple edu  carter ames  writes          i thought the first thread was hilarious  so here goes another post       some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries         one year  i left the batteries in the garage   the garage is unheated      they were left in their places that they needed to be   one in the riding   lawnmower  what a lux  and one in each motorcycle   the battery in the    riding lawnmower was about     years old  and one of the cycle batteries    was new  and one was around   years old   upon spring time  i discovered   that all of the batteries were dead  and needed to be recharged   they all   worked properly  except for the older ones  and they had to be replaced    about halfway through the summer    they had originally been stored   in the garage  and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring      last year  i decided to bring them in to the basement  which has two parts    one is dirt and brick  and the other is concrete   i brought in all three  and   discovered in the spring   about    days ago  that not only were the batteries   dead  but when i put the charger on them  the charger said  hmmmmmmmm  and    the amp meter read around                 in other words  it was pinned    the internal circut tripped  and i went on to the other batteries   they   were the same         realizing that we still had   gigantic sailboat batteries  also lead   acid  i decided to put the charger on them    these had been sitting for around   and a half years  on the brick and dirt part  and noticed that they only   needed a small charge  around   hours or so on trickle   i tested them   by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts  and they   worked fine for around    of  em       this leads me to believe one of several things            i bought really    tty batteries last year   sorta true            the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the           batteries            there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the              room where the concrete is             the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air            better than concrete        btw  i can almost waterski in the dirt room            any other ideas         could be the aliens  anything is possible         the lead acid secondary cell releases energy  electricity  with the following chemical reaction    pb   pbo     h so       pbso     h     lead and lead  iv  oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water   the standard heats of formation at    c     f  of the various compounds are                  heat of formation compound      at    c  kcal mole                                     pb                      pbo                    h so                     pbso                     h                          the heat of reaction at    c is therefore       kcal per mole pbso  produced  note that lead sulfate is not very soluble         grams per     grams water at    c   and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring  or the cathode  positive terminal  of the battery    i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms  but i may be wrong   oh well  i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate  and i don t feel like thinking through it right now     what is important to notice here is that the reaction  as you knew it would be  is exothermic  or energy discharging   if moisture with dissolved electrolytes  acid rain  condenses on the battery  a conductive path between the terminals may form   this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds  the reaction is reversible  if electricity  from an alternator or battery charger  is put back into the battery    lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge   each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction   the non reacting posts  terminals  of the lead acid battery are there to remove  or add  electric energy during a discharge  or charge    because the reaction is exothermic  it has a tendency to happen  though quite slowly under normal circumstances   so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea  it is not a total solution    to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth  dirt   one should recall lechatelier s principle  which can be paraphrased as   anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position   here are the thermal

thermal conductivity for  dirt   diatomaceous earth  goes down with temperature   also      c is about     k  and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth   the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of    greater than that of dirt  and is     times greater than wood    it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood   at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring  energy is being released  either as electricity or heat    thermal conductivity of air is about       btu  hr ft ft  f ft    during storage  except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery  this energy is mostly released as heat   the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface   thus  if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface  at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature  the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about    times faster than that on dirt    this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play   removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion   if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature  keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced   a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface   store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement  and you have   surfaces removing energy  which  pulls  the reaction along    also  if water evaporates from the battery  that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water   this will tend to drive the discharge reaction    jeff white      jhwhit

around for backup  you know      actually  no i don t have a tape drive   in the event of a total hard disk failure  i reinstall the apps from originals  and restore the data from the backups i keep of that   with upwards of    mb of stuff on my hard disk  there is no way i m going to try and back it all up without a tape drive      would be nice to have one though     ram is something you add all the time  so no   it s more like bios   manufacturer and or processor type          etc    data cannot be used    esp with these new flash rom bios machines with updates on a diskette    maybe  maybe not   today it doesn t happen as often  i would hope   but then if a bios is buggy and the user gets an upgrade  the bios information is going to change  at least the date anyway   tagging the bios manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard   this type of upgrade doesn t require a hard disk backup restore     on the other hand  to make this less intrusive it could be disguised as    please insert original disk  xx as i need file yyyyyy for update           it would be perfectly reasonable     sort of    as long as it wasn t done too terribly often   otherwise i think it would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software         this is silly   it s much easier to loan disks to a friend and let    them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk  and then   give  them that   your scheme isn t going to stop anyone      of course it is easier   are you saying then the originals should allow   only one install   what is your point    of course not   if something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled  the  worst  thing i want that software telling me is  this software has already been registered to  blank  and it is against the law to install it on other machines    or something similar  access for windows does this and it only requires a click on  ok  to go away   pretty non intrusive  but it gets the point across     what i said was the program should have certain restriction  such as the   restrict to one machine  until the program is registered with the   manufacturer   the manufacturer will then supply the   then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction   and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the  registered to xxx  screen    this is a great idea   i like the key system that some shareware products use   the only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost

word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage  converted to a sawtooth wave  to get a duty cycle  however  i am leary of this method because it a  requires a lot of parts  and  more importantly  b  creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line  i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference  but that would require more parts and boost the price further   someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input   bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on chip  unfortunately  he couldn t remember the chip number or the manufacturer  if anyone else has heard of this chip  please e mail me   i am building this project as a  dimmer box  for a light controller circuit and it is important that the

silver solder is not used for general soldering tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth  silver solder  when exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field  will actually grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field  for this  reason  silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies  fortunatly  tin lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites as fast as silver solder  therefore  it is used extensively     jerry long  long spk hp com

    units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side  viewed from front  of the printer   newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide   the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out   there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation   hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism   i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer   i don t have the information handy   i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit   hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade   i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet       the kit was fairly expensive   you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet     now that prices have declined so much   upgrading an original deskjet to     requires a fair amount of skill  but no soldering   upgrading a deskjet plus to a     is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts   contact your hp service center for further information   the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers  especially the newer laser printers   the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line   this makes no material difference for lasers  but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster   as you might guess  the result is hideously slow printing   the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior   from the way wordperfect works  this would not be easy to change   windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows    the pcl  dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page     dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory   an uncompressed image could be as large as about     kbytes  but the printer needs about    k of memory for its internal house keeping   laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations   deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts   a single page from a laserjet only requires about    seconds   this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer   the presumption  of course  being that the laser printer has completed its warm up cyle   until ink chemistry is changed  wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable   i won t use the word impossible  but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely  chosing an appropriate paper type helps  but does not eliminate the problem   laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components   hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges  mitigating the material waste problem to a degree   energy waste could use more work   warm up times have decreased  allowing stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv   kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system   the image drum is good for approximately    k copies   it is a very nice print engine   i wish hp used the kyocera engine   kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system   the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp s laser printers   the pick up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out   the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper  the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service   replacement cost for the transport is almost        the feed rollers are not separately replacable  though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician  i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer   it depends upon the application which printer is best for you   if you only print   or    pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output  the deskjet is a very good choice   as noted  the

not that the question is anything important  but i am still curious   why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green  i have seen  a few blue ones  but no red  yellow  company logo etc  is there a  technical reason or could it be that the marketing  geniuses  have  not tought about it  yet    the green layer is a solder mask  and is used to make a finished board look neat  and to avoid solder bridges  especially when using wave soldering  or any other mechanized approach   i ve seen red mask  but most that i ve seen are green   a bakelite board will look brown in colour  and  if the solder mask is put on  looks like a brown board with green  paint  on either side  or just one side  of the board  a fibreglass board will look green from the side  because the green solder mask makes the board appear that colour  if you got a fibreglass board with no mask  it would be a whitish grey colour  teflon boards do exist  as well    but i m not sure about that one   i d guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green  so they re not about to change  also  any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards  a lot of companies do not make their own boards    they ship them to a real boardhouse      newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  kschang sfsuvax  sfsu edu  kuo sheng  kasey  chang  subject  re

batteries part        the lead acid secondary cell releases energy  electricity  with the following  chemical reaction      pb   pbo     h so       pbso     h       lead and lead  iv  oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water  heats of formation deleted   the heat of reaction at    c is therefore       kcal per mole pbso  produced   note that lead sulfate is not very soluble         grams per     grams water  at    c   and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is  occurring  or the cathode  positive terminal  of the battery    i am almost  sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms  but i may be  wrong   oh well  i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate  and i don t feel  like thinking through it right now    the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution  pbso  is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out   also  h so  is in a water solution as  h    and so      thus the heats of formation of pbso  and h so  are for the most part irrelevant    what is important to notice here is that the reaction  as you knew it would be   is exothermic  or energy discharging   as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic  heat producing    more about this later    what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this   we re talking lead acid batteries of course  the battery slowly self discharges   as this discharge takes place two things happen   the level of pb   ions in the acid solution increases  i e  the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved            the level of h    ions in the acid solution decreases  i e  the solution            becomes less acidic  or more like water if you like   now  as the post to which i am responding correctly stated  pbso  will precipitate in a water  non acid  solution   when the battery dies  i e  is fully discharged  we end up with a high concentration of pb   and so    in water   so pbso  forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery  of course this happens in varying degrees  the more discharged  the more precipitate forms    the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery   if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate  more common in a newer battery  a dead short results   i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition  but they are for the most part useless   they can dissolve the pbso  but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly   you may have some success with these products for a newer battery    stuff deleted   to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on  concrete as opposed to wood or earth  dirt   one should recall lechatelier s  principle  which can be paraphrased as   anything subjected to some stress will  act to move to a more comfortable position   here are the thermal conductivities  of a some selected materials   stuff deleted   this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play   removing energy from  the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion   if the  reaction normally occurs at room temperature  keeping the battery at that  temperature requires the removal of any heat produced   a concrete surface is  a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface   store a battery in the corner  of a poured concrete basement  and you have   surfaces removing energy  which   pulls  the reaction along   this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid  in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures   a logical consequence of the above argument is this   if you really want your car to start  lower the battery temperature to      to  pull  the reaction along    we all know from experience  at  least those of us in canada do  it gets cold up here   that this is not true   if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery    besides which  there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature   the air would amply dissipate any  such heat  whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not   this  is of course irrelevant  since you would want the battery to be cool  during storage    just keep the battery in a cool dry place

filled fiberglass is blue    teflon is white      rubbish  the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used  older boards  bakelite and phenolic  rarely used a solder mask  these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques  and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them  these days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering  and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments   the light and dark green boards ofter seen have a  dry film  mask applied to them  usually applied as a complete film photographically produced   the blue  and red or orange  boards are a two part

such an expensive  metal       this is called silver bearing solder    it is used to solder to devices that have silvered contacts    one application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes    these were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches  if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic    the silver was quite thin    the    is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead     thus  no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution    other devices that use silver contacts are quartz

amps for    v service and running    v mains cables out  which will minimize the line drop   if these don t work  though  you re going to need a bigger generator   i assume that you re using well

piezoelectric accelerometers in them   i know that the gm cars use the setra units   the cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing automotive unit   incidentally  these things aren t very linear  but for the application they would do a fine job    scott  newsgroup  sci electronics document id        from  katop astro ocis temple edu  chris katopis  subject  phantoms in my sony strvx    receiver   while i have gotten     years out of this digital receiver  it has been acting verry strange of late   i hope that  the following  symptoms may help someone diagnose the error     i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had   has long died thus if i unplug it   it won t remember the presets    it has given up listening to the remote    i tried changing the remote s batteries  when i try a remote function   the receiver registers that it received it  a green remote light flashes  but the right function doesn t happen   if any function at all    also strange  when i hit  the  mute  button  for example  the display panel goes black   yikes   i ve never seen that before         before all the strangeness started  the system turned itself off and on again   by itself    sometimes it won t play a radio station  so i have to kinda twist it   yes kinda flex the motherboard  chasis  for it to get the radio tuning back   the aux in function always works however      it is inconvenient  but not inconvenient enough to pay an  expensive repair fee   while  i m not a hardware guy  i wonder  if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix  the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go      someone told me this unit series has a bad voltage amp chip    anyway     arghh  cjk    newsgroup  sci electronics document id

summaries    possible advantages would be     free distribution    fast acceptance    online discussion between authors and readers    this would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the  articles and one perhaps without for discussion    i think its a great  but idealistic idea  a reseacher will first of all try  to publish a worthy paper in a credible  professional magazine and not in a  community like usenet which is infamous for lots  not all  of junk  information  the papers that will be  published  here will  in general  be  of low quality  also  it is improbable that any credit will be given to a  researcher who publish here   and sadly  that is nowadays a main reason for  publishing   usenet is great for informal discussions and free exchange of

itself  they decided to discuss the  non technical part of the issue   so  here i go with my limited knowledge  about this issue   hoping you guys cut the crap and talk about the real  technical ways to do this   the methods that i am aware that are effective  are        laser hole burning   this would leave the disk damaged  so if you format     that particular sector of the disk you can not write to it   it is very                                                                 laser holes are  or were  used to prevent someone from making exact copies  of a disk  you do not want to write to the damaged disk  only read and use  the programs       hard for crackers to damage the disk exactly the same way     i remember a program called copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser  hole in it  i think it simulates the laser hole  after copying the disk the  program is  if necessary  used in conjunction with a program called nokey or  something   the program tells you which program to

exothermic   i am glad   you do not dispute this point   if you don t want the lead storage battery   to discharge  it should be stored such that its charged state is the   equilibrium state   during winter  the ground  be it covered with   concrete  dirt  or wood  maintains a cooler temperature on average than   the surrounding air or the battery   the heat capacity of air is less than   that of concrete  dirt  or wood  so it heats faster   conversely  air cools   faster  too       the normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated   garage or basement   the storage surface is often cooler than the   surrounding air  with the battery temperature somewhere in between   e g     the basement air temperature may be    f  the floor temperature    f  and   the battery temperature    f       the air temperature is higher than the battery temperature   the heat of   reaction is not going to move up the gradient   the floor temperature is   lower than the battery temperature  and heat is going to move to it   the   floor is an incredible heat sink        might depend on where you live    i know locally  for most of the winter  the ground  and concrete floor  within sheds and garages  unheated  is  signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature   the air does get  warmer during the day  but during the night  the ground and concrete  is definitely warmer  especially when protected by the walls from the  albedo effect   and the nights are longer by several hours than the  days      rest of quoted text deleted       jeff white       jhwhit   ulkyvx louisville edu    richard dell  sorry about following up my own article  but i wanted to continue that what might be being missed here is that the important thing might not be temperature differences per se  but the action of heat sinking the battery   perhap someone could conduct an experiment  taking two identical lead acid batteries  placing both on wooden shelves  but putting one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink   this would eliminate the  concrete floor effect   and keep both batteries at the same ambient temperature   i think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent  but the one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have some validity   richard dell   \n"
